    "text": "I spotted a green light speeding in all directions in the skies of Uzbekistan. \n \nWhen I served in the Peace Corps in Uzbekistan I lived in a small town by the name Shavat, in the Khorezm region, not far from the Turkmenistan border.  I was a teacher in a small school and rented a house there. \n \nOne morning I woke up for school.  I can’t remember exactly which time it was , but I know it was between 6:30 and 7:10 AM there.  It was still dark.  I stepped outside to walk to the outhouse in my backyard and as I did so I happened to look up in the sky and  noticed something that seemed out of place there. \n \nIt was a green ball of light, moving slowly in all directions (up and down, right and left).  It wasn’t just an insignificant spec in the sky but big and bright enough to have a true presence there.  I knew immediately that it wasn’t a shooting star, an airplane, a satellite, or a meteor because I had seen those things before and knew how they moved.  This object moved deliberately, covering wide distances in the sky in only seconds, as if somebody were moving a laser pointer dot all around on a blackboard.  Then it sped away and disappeared. \n \nThat day I went to school and told colleagues about it.  These were Uzbek nationals.  One friend, a young woman my age who was my counterpart, was skeptical and treated me like I was crazy while my director told me had seen something similar years before.  I also told another friend whom I didn’t work with-- a young female teacher at a nursery school. \n \nThe next morning I woke up again around the same time and just like the morning before I stepped into my backyard on my way to outhouse and saw it again.  This time for only a split second before it sped away. \n \nLater that week the nursery school teacher I had told my story to told me that she had seen the same thing while outside at her house, only late in PM hours. \n \nMonths passed.  Later, in the Spring, my counterpart at school who had treated me like I was crazy when I told her my story apologized to me one day, and told me that she and her family had all witnessed the same object in the sky over the weekend, late at night.  Her sighting took place for an extended period of time and witnessed by more than at least three people  I have no opinion as to what this object was, only that it wasn’t normal and that it was definitely worth reporting.  Especially since it kept appearing. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Golden orb follows car, then changes into black triangle ufo, stops , and \"waits\" for them to pass close by. \n \nIt was New Years day, 1998. Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA. \n \n Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year's night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of \"helicopter\" or \"star\". As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph. \n \n The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid \"gold-light orb\" [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle—keeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside. \n \n The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object's respective sides for only a moment—disappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the “police” lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission. \n \n As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to “branch out” into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at “walking speed”. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building. \n \n Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the \"front\" and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like \"baseball stadium lights\", and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two \"front\" sides [see FIGURE 4]. \n \n This large object was “fixed” in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and “weren’t supposed to be there.” The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint “circuit board” type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the “belly” of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a “Star Destroyer” space vehicle from the Star Wars movies. \n \n After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they “have to get out of here.” He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later. \n \n The total experience was less than 5 minutes. \n \n The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again. \n \n The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big “UFO buff” from the time he was young, the word “UFO” or “alien” never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn’t “freaking out” at the time. The best explanation was that “he was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.”  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The craft seemed to appear out of nowhere and hovered over the neighborhood for a few minutes. We were on the third story and the craft wasnt much higher than us, though it was about 100 or so yards away. We estimate that the craft itself was about 50 yards across. It was disc shaped and had multiple multi-colored lights that were constantly blinking around the entire ship. When asked to describe it, I always state that it had a great resemblence to the ship from the movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". However, I had not seen this film prior to my sighting, so I do not think that had any effect on my recollection. \n \nIt hovered briefly over the neighborhood and began to glide further and further away. We saw it slowly float behind some trees then it suddenly gained a great amount of speed and disappeared. The following morning, several people around the neighborhood mentioned the encounter as well. \n \nTil this day, my mother, cousin, and I still stand by our recollection of the event.",

It was a moonless sky before sunrise.  At least I do not remember seeing the moon. I saw three white or yellowish white lights moving slowly from the west to the east in a triangular formation at an undeterminable altitude and velocity.  I assumed that these lights were all part of one object because they did not move in relation to each other (their triangular pattern remained stable).  There was no red flashing red light that is typically seen with aircraft at night nor was there a sound of a jet or propeller engine nor was there the chopping sound of the rotary blades of a helicopter.  There was no apparent sound at all.  The light formation was close enough so that if I extended my hand that the two outer lights could just be seen on either side of my index finger.  The lack of red flashing lights is what captured my attention and inclined me to get a better look.  I was indoors when I first saw it but I went out doors within less than a minute of first seeing it and watched it move east disappearing into the eastern sky.  When I got out doors it was still close enough to still clearly make out three lights.  Several minuets later as the sun was coming up I saw an airplane moving in exactly the opposite direction with the typical red flashing light and propeller engine sound. \n \nI assume it could be some type of military air craft.",

At first, we thought it was a large aircraft with it's landing lights on, heading westbound toward Tulsa International Airport. As we continued to observe the light, we noticed that it did not move. We were able to get out of our car and watch the light for an hour, and it never changed position in relation to us, the horizon, or any other observable object, while the stars progressed across the sky as normal. \n \n The object is obviously geosynchronus as it has been in the same position in the sky visible at the same basic time every morning for three months. The only time it is otherwise visible is on Monday nights, when it is visible all night long. It is not visible any other night of the week until approx. 04:30am. \n \n I have written NASA asking what this might be, but have received no response from them. At leasat ten other people have observed this same phenomenon, almost all are law enforcement officers as I. i believe it may simply be a satellite, but it's position does not match anything I have been able to find on sites such as NASA's downloadable satellite tracking software. \n \n Not saying it's a spaceship or anything, but no one seems to be willing to tell me what it is. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note: Probable sighting of celestial body.

I became stunt for few seconds then i turned about and grab my cousin's arm who was standing directly infront of me and told him to look at that direction and then i found the thing disappeared. \n \n i never got to tell anyone because i thought no one here would believe me. i live in brunei and this place is a small country so maybe there's lesser chance for me to meet someone who have seen similar things. i was surprise to find this website where i can share with everyone who probably would have the encounter the same thing. \n \n Even today i never got to tell much people here because im worried they will think im NUTs :0  from my memory, i remember that the object was not the typical saucer look which we always get on TV/indepandent day/internet/discovery channel. \n \nIt was something different. it was very high-tech and unique. it is nothing like what i've ever seen in any movies. There were many details on the body of the craft as if it looks like pipes / wiring attached to the body. from the distance where i was standing, i consider the object small. probably measuring about 4 to 5 feet lenght x  4 feet width x 3 to 5 feet thickness. no lights were seen. i can see that object with available lights because i was close enough from that subject as the house had some lightings around the surrounding of the garden to lite up some part of the roof. \n \n The stangest thing i canot figure out how it can do was; the object was actually floating on top of the roof (probably less then a feet away from the roof), the roof were soft and old and it should have made noise. even rain drops falling onto the roof would make noise but from my distant i hear nothing from the object and the roof (the corner part) was not even rattling. \n \n after that incident i've always wish to see it another time. \n \ni told some of my friends i wish to see them again. i consider myself very lucky to see it that close because from documentary, discovery channels, books, internet sites, videos...all those who said they have seen are from a very great distant and they can't really judge how it look like. most of them say its like a saucer. but for me, it can look like anything. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I tried to focus on them as best I could while at the same time looking forward to watch the road.  \n \nThe formation itself seemed to be 2-3 miles wide and the mass was fairly low to the ground.  \n \n After about 10 minutes they blinked out all at once, as if they vanished into thin air.  \n \nWhen I got home i tried to analyze what I had saw.  I took mental notes, NO sound even with window down at a red light, No blinking lights, No smoke, sparks, or downward movment. the were not flairs!  \n \nIt was a sighting i will never forget. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

    "text": "Series of 17 unidentifiable lights cross the skies of Northern California \n \nAt midnight, Jan 1st of 2007, we stepped out on the deck for New Years and observed a bright Satellite moving Southeast from the Northwest. Magnitude was as great as Mars at it's closest.  \n \nThen 2 more appeared behind the roof into view, so we stepped out to see if there were more moving across the sky. \n \n17 lights in total, all within 70 degrees of each other moving South-East from the North-West.  All were the same brightness and color. A bright Orange to reddish. \n \nAs the first 3-4 moved through the 12 o'clock(meridian) they started to change course. A few slowed then turned about 90 degrees and out of the path, then a few faded and made a left 270. 2 actually stopped, as noted against a clear sky of stars and a bright moon. All in all, about 7 or 8 \"danced\" overhead, the rest continued on course. \n \nAt this point I recalled we had just bought a new video camera so I ran in, grabbed it and shot the last few minutes of the \"satellites\" continuing across the sky.  At this point, pretty much all those that had not faded were continuing SE bound. \n \nSince moving into the country from the city 5 years ago, watching satellites and meteors has become one of my families evening pastimes.  We are quite adept at this pastime now and can identify the difference between Satellites, Space Station, Etc. and Aircraft.  And I have spent the better part of my 36 years, watching aircraft,  As well, I am employed as an ((deleted--aviation specialist.)).  So something like this event really stood out. \n \nThere were no contrails visible as they would have been with the moon as a backlight. There were no stobe lights or red and green wings lights as associated with A/C.  There was no sound associable with these \"satellites\". The time for the \"Non Dancing\" lights to traverse the sky was about 9 minutes, the same as a satellite or the Space Shuttle.   \n \nA quiet check of the net did show that the prevailing winds aloft were moving in the same direction. \n \nLighted Weather Balloons?  ROV's?   I truly hope someone else who might have noticed these lights will also report something.",

When we looked up we noticed what looked like a whole swath of stars that were amber in color were travelling in a column, we watched them for about 13 to 14 minutes.  I happened to have a pair of binoculars with me and managed to hand the binoculars to everyone in our party.  From what I saw, when I had my binoculars were these objects were spherical in shape and were slightly pulsing in 1 second intervals.  Some were swirling around one another.  At the end of the 13 - 14 minute window I saw the objects gather in a swarm on the horizon and split off, one part of the swarm going right the others going left with only a couple going straight up and disappearing.  A few minutes after the sighting I noticed a couple jets in the vincinity. \n \nOur party had one amateur astronomer and one fireman.  Our astronomer states they were not stars or airplanes. Please contact me if anyone else has reported anything of this sort in the area. Every person in the party is still stunned from this experience as am I, we need to know that we are not crazy.",

I was the only witness to this event that I know of (no one I know made any mention of it, anyway), though anyone could have seen it, provided they had the right view. \n \n At about 12:11 AM on New Year's Day, 1-January-2007, I witnessed a single, strangely bright, white light in the sky north of Cedar Falls, Iowa.  At first, I thought it was either an airplane or an unusually bright star.  I realized it wasn't an airplane when I noticed that not only were there none of the telltale noises of an airplane, but there were none of the characteristic blinking lights either. \n \n My suspicions of it being a star were disproved when it slowly began growing in size and moving slightly upward, as if whatever it was moved closer to my location.  It stopped where it was after about 20 seconds, and at this point it was about the size of a pencil eraser when held at arm's length.  It hovered in the same position for about 40 seconds.  It then moved slowly to the east for about 5 seconds, before moving first up, then down, all slowly.  It returned to its original height, then moved back west to its original position.  It stopped again, then moved west and began the same process once more: up, down, middle. \n \n It returned to its first stopping position once again, and repeated the same ordeal, moving up, then down, then middle.  It then began moving slowly to the east once more, and when it stopped in the same position it had before, I thought it was about to repeat the whole thing over again.  But after sitting still for about 15 seconds, it began moving fairly quickly to the southwest, which, from where I was standing, almost seemed like it was just circling around the east side of the city and heading south.  It became obstructed by houses and trees at that point, and although I continued to watch for it, I never saw it again.",

Then another light appeared out of no where and joined the other object, circling it a few times then disappeared behind another range. It looked as if they were 'playing'- we watched for a good 15 minutes as they would move straight up and down and then sideways, at one point I thought I spotted a third but it was so difficult to tell because it appeared so dim- They would pulsate, these objects would get very bright and change almost like a rainbow of warmer colors red yellows etc. They did get very dim and disappear and then reappear very bright or fade back into view, very strange, yet very exciting- I would have sat there forever but the boys in the backseat were so scared they were getting sick to ther stomachs-Sounds silly but I though well If I can see them this clear they must be able to see my headlights, so I jokingly flashed my head lights on and off a few times  but what happened then really freaked us all out- both objects shot out in a perfect line up as if someone screamed at them to stop- I started to drive and the objects slowly followed us around the ridgline for about 20 seconds then one stayed with us for apprx 2 minutes as if Peeking at us from behind the mountain-  I am still bothered that I could not sit there forever and watch- We tried to capture them on video but it was sso dark It justwould not focus so far away :-(( I want to go back I want to see more I guess!

This incident recieved zero coverage on our television service, However this article was printed in a local paper. It is now 10 days and no follow ups have been reported anywhere in the media. \n \n UFO crash still a mystery 03/01/2007 21:58  - (SA) \t Lephalale - Mystery still surrounds the UFO that reportedly crashed somewhere in the Lephalale (Ellisras) region on Monday. \n \n On Tuesday, it was reported that Leonie Ras, the administrative manager of Lephalale saw a strange object fall to the ground at about 04:33 on her daughter's farm east of the town. \n \n She was lying in bed checking her SMS messages when she heard a noise \"like an Airbus aircraft firing up its motors\". \n \n There was no thunder or lightning and the noise grew louder, eventually sounding like a million turbines screaming in unison, said Ras. \n \n She walked to the bedroom window and saw the clouds taking on a bright orange-red colour. \n \n She described the object as a bright object that \"plunged from the clouds to the earth, at a terrible speed, and hit the ground with an almighty bang.\"  It looked like Haley's comet, \"round in the front and with an orange-red tail following behind\". \n \n On Wednesday, the Lephalale police station reportedly received numerous enquiries following the incident. \n \n But the area was vast and there was no way of knowing where to start looking, said Superintendent Wessel Geldenhuys. \n \n He added that the object could have fallen in Botswana, which is situated about 45km away. \n \n Geldenhuys said that Ras's neighbour had also seen the UFO, but that so far, no one else had seen the object or had any idea where it was. \n \n \"We have had many queries, but no answers,\" he said.",

My husband said \"look up, what is that?\"  The first one was round and black with silver lining.  It just floated above our house while we were outside for a new year's day barbeque.  It floated for about 5-10 minutes, then slowly went up into the clouds and disappeard.. the second one came about 5 minutes later.  At first it was round and silver, suddenly, it changed to a tube shape and turn gold, then it went back to being round and silver and had four round gold things spinning around it.  It kept changing back and forth and just sat there for about ten minutes.  Neither one of the objects ever made a sound.  Suddenly, several military jets started going over the house and the object floated up and disappeared.  I don't mean it disappeard into the clouds, I mean it actually disappeard, like a cartoon.  When my son and I turned around, we saw a black object coming straight down from the sky into a field across the street.  It came down really fast and kind of looked like a person parachuting, but with no parachute.  It actually looked like a tall black object with two legs, like a human, but the upper body was not clear to us.  No one else saw the third \"thing\".  I really can't describe what it was because it came down so fast.  The military jets continued to fly around for about half an hour and left.   \n \nSeveral people in my family were outside that day, but only a few of us will admit what we saw.",

    "text": "Lights moving from south to north, low to ground and slow without any sound. \n \nThe event happened on January 1st, 2007.  It was an exceptionally dark night; usually there is some minimal light pollution out in all directions from my house, but it seemed much lesser that night in retrospect. \n \n I was doing work as I generally do at that time of night with my window blinds up, as I like to see the sky.  It happened to be a very nice, clear night out without any clouds. \n \n While working away, I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, to the south, something with lights in the sky.  I glanced at it and realized that it wasn't either an airplane or helicopter. \n \n As it was so dark that night, I was unable to make out any shape of the object.  It was emitting absolutely no sound, which is the first thing that struck me as strange.  The object was very low to the ground, far too low for a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft; by my best estimation, somewhere between 100-150 feet from the ground. \n \n The object had four lights that I could see; two in the front and the other two swept out to the sides and back a bit.  All four of the lights seemed to be emitting a light that looked color-wise to a warm flourescent light, but emitted light as strong and as clear as an industrial bulb would.  I would also like to note that these lights did not seem to shine any light down onto the ground, even from the low altitude. \n \n The object was moving at a quite slow, steady pace, estimated at about 20-30 MPH.  It moved from south to north without stopping, changing course or speed as far as I watched. \n \n Had I been in my senses, I would have jumped up and ran to the front door; I was, however, stunned at what I had just witnessed, wondering if it could have been something ordinary. \n \n I believe it was not, however, due to the facts that a) I saw no landing lights or blinking lights on the craft, and b) There is no landing strip and/or airport north of my house; the nearest one is about three miles south-east.",

It is sort of the aviation attic of America. \n \nIn the one hangar lying on the floor just in front of the then unrestored B-29 'The Enola Gay', was a craft called a 'flying saucer'   It was a one man round craft about 25 feet in diameter.   It had US Air Force written on both sides of the cockpit.  It was NOT the de havilin ground effects craft nor the navy's 'Flying Flapjack'.   \n \nThe Ideal Toy Corporation made a model of the thing back in the fifties.

Deputy Governor General of Kerman province Abulghassem Nasrollahi told FNA that the crash which was followed by an explosion and a thick spiral of smoke has caused no casualties or damage to properties. \n \nHe further denied earlier reports that the explosion has been the result of a plane or chopper crash, reminding that all the passing aircrafts have been reported as sound and safe. \n \nThe official further stated that investigations are underway by police and other relevant authorities in this regard. \n \nWhile other reports spoke of meteors, Nasrollahi said there were no conclusive witnesses in this regard but he did not dismiss the possibility that the crash has been caused by a meteor. \n \nEye-witnesses assure that the explosion has been caused as a result of the crash of a radiant unidentified flying object onto the ground. \n \nMeantime, an informed source told FNA that the object has been on fire and there has been thick smoke coming out of it prior to the crash, concluding that the object couldn't have been a meteor as meteors do not smoke. \n \nThe source also said that the crash has been witnessed by people in several cities, and mentioned that the rendezvous point is located 100 kilometers from the provincial capital city of Kerman. \n \nHe said that people in the city of Rafsanjan also reported to have witnessed a similar incident several days ago. \n \nSimilar crash incidents have been witnessed frequently during the last year all across Iran, and officials believe that the objects could be spy planes or a hi-tech espionage device. \n \n(Description of Source: Tehran Fars News Agency (Internet Version-WWW) in English -- Privately-owned news agency.

This was in a East direction. She had sat there many times before without seeing lights.  \n \nOn this occasion, the light caught her attention.  Light appeared as a Yellow White light that was stationary.   \n \nWitness moved head while sitting to get a better view throught the window blinds. The blinds were about 1/3 to 1/2 open at the time.  The witness said the object was above the one story building next door.  It sat stationary for 15 seconds then it took off in northernly direction in a diagonal upward direction.  It was gone within 1 sec and the observer stated the light left a visual trail during that departure.  Possible visual after-effect.  Witness claims no head movement during this departure sequence as best as she could remember.   \n \nThe witness reported no change in the size or shape during the entire visual encounter.  Object remained circular in shape and witness describes as a \"light shinning at you\" appearance.  This description was further clarified by the witness as a briht center with rays of light all around it.  Her impression was that this object was close and it was estimated to be about 300 feet away and about 25 ft above the ground and about 2 ft in diameter based on similar size objects like a fan on a trailer nearby at the same distance but only 8 ft off the ground.  The witness then went up to the window to open the blinds futher and then looked and saw nothing more for one minute.  \n \nThe same color light was seen again toward the southeast but appeared smaller (about a bbsize at arms length) and assumed to be further away and still above the building.

    "text": "Triangular shaped object see over Rt.14 - Rt. 68 in Inverness Illinois. \n \nI am a physician, whose hobby is astronomy.  \n \nI was driving northbound on Ela road just south if Dundee Ave. tonight when I noticed an aircraft initially traveling southwest and banking leftward toward a south-southeasterly direction.  The radius of these turns was small, and very smooth.  \n \nAs the aircraft approached, I notices green wing-tip lights as opposed to the customary red left wing, green right wing tips.  I wondered what kind of airplane this was.  \n \nAs I continued to drive northbound I could see the shape of the craft via the light configuration.  It had a triangular shape and appeared to be hovering and not moving across my field of vision as a regular airplane would do.   \n \nI rolled open my sunroof and heard no airplane prop or jet engine noises.  \n \nThe craft then proceed to slowly move in a continuingly southeastern direction, at what seemed like a slow drifting motion.  I then lost sight of it due to the tree-line.  \n \nThe sky tonight is clear and cold...about 30 degrees.  I'm not sure what it was.  I would estimate that its altitude was approx. 2000-3000 ft. up.   \n \nI also noticed a centrally positioned red light in the middle of the undersurface of the craft.   \n \nI'm wondering if anyone else saw this object tonight.  \n \nMy sighting lasted about 60 seconds.  Closest intersection is Il. Rt 14 and Dundee Rd. @ 10.00 p.m..",

We all three then looked out the back window but only one light was visible at this point so we all three decided to go outside for a better view.   \n \nOnce outside we could still only see one light which had remained in the same spot since I first saw it and which was still not making any sound.    \n \nWe continued to watch the light for another couple of minutes when it began moving northward and then shot off instantaneously out of sight just like you see UFO's do in movies.   \n \nI have never seen anything like it in my life and I am certain it was no currently known man made flying technology.",

We went up to my roof on New Years Eve with the idea that we might catch the last of the celebratory fireworks going off in the downtown or marina area of San Francisco.  We saw a little bit of fireworks but not much.  We decided to say on the roof for a moment to enjoy the stars.  It had been cloudy and raining for days and having a clear sky was something special that night. \n \n Suddenly we saw 3 or 4 glowing orange lights moving North almost directly overhead.  They were small, about the size of your thumbnail, and unblinking.  By definition, these were of course UFO's.  They were not like any other flying object either one of us had seen before. \n \n We stayed in place on the roof watching the sky to see if anything else appeared and about 1 minute later we saw the same thing.  These were also travelling North.  Again, maybe 4 minutes later we saw a larger group headed North.  This time I remembered to count them.  There were 8 of them.  This time I was watching very intently to see if there was any movement that would show them to be using anti-gravity technology.  I was looking for any sudden sharp turns or accelerations.  There was one object that made a sudden change of course.  It had been traveling in a 3 o'clock position to an object then suddenly moved to a 6 o'clock position.  There is no way any known aircraft could have made that maneuver. \n \n About 6 minutes after that we saw 2 more of the same lights traveling East.

The lights were in a diamond pattern, three lights were white and one that blinked red on the front side of the diamond.  These lights did not blink like beacons on commercial aircraft.  The white ones were a very fast strobe and/or a shuttering effect with the red light blinking a steady pulse. \n \n We were stopped at the 177 and 62 junction for more that 25 minutes with the headlights off.

We got out of the van for about 5-10 minutes, but it was cold so we jumped back in.  My friend had cleaned all the windows before we left so it was crystal clear.  About 5 or 10 minutes before we started driving again, we saw a dark cloud about the size of 3 football fields flashing a white light every other second or so.  The light was flashing from inside the cloud.   The size of the light was about 60-100 feet in diameter.  This lasted about 5-8 minutes.

We had been in Arizona to bring in the New Year.  We were driving on Hwy 62 West about 2 miles from the 177 when I noticed a strange object with strobing lights appear to the North.  At first, I thought it might be an airplane, but then, it did a complete backflip.  I told my friends there was a spaceship beside us.  The object moved at such a high rate of speed and then would suddenly stop or make circles.  When we got to the 177, there is a 3 way intersection and we decided to stop.  We watched the object for a minute or two and my friend noticed another one to the southeast.  Amazed, we watched.  My friend got out to relieve himself when he told me to get out.  As I got out, I noticed one directly above our heads.  The were 4 lights on the underbelly of the craft.  There was one red and 3 white strobing lights seeming to make a diamond shaped pattern.  The craft hovered there for about 15 seconds or so and propelled forward.  We then looked to the southeast and saw 10 more or so more objects moving toward the southwest in no particular formation. \n \n There were clouds in the sky because we really couldn't see the stars that well, but these objects were flying below the cloud layer.  We stayed parked there for about  30 minutes with the lights off.  There were a handful of other cars on the highway so there were no distractions from other headlights.  We saw probably 25-50 aircraft that night while we were parked.  Truly amazing.  There was so much activity.  Before we started driving again we saw a huge dark cloud directly above us.  It was flashing a huge light from inside the cloud.  The object seemed to be going in the same direction as the other aircraft to the southwest.

She turned of the car and shut off the headlights. 10 seconds passed, I was staring at the car when I saw the entire ground light up as if a bolt of lightning had struck within a 500 yard radius. My first thought was that someone was playing with a camera flash nearby because there were no clouds the sky was clear. I looked up and over towards Cassiopeia and spotted a huge glowing orange object. My wife ran over to where I was standing and we watched it flare up and settle into a consistent magnitude. Comparing it to a couple of stars, the object did not appear to move for the first 4 minutes or so. I ran and grabbed my binoculars and upon closer review, the object seemed to be spherical and above a 30,000 foot ceiling. I am assuming this because I could see a slight hint of atmosphere distorting the light. The event lasted approx. 6 minutes. At the end, the light flickered and faded rapidly. It did not look as though it was moving away, but rather that it lost its illumination much like T.V. set turning off in slow motion. From edge out, the light faded inward until only a small dot could be seen. The tiny dot then just disappeared.",

    "text": "Green fire balls, Texas Panhandle, late 1950's. \n \nMy recent \"lights in the sky, with military jets\" experience of 19-Oct-2009 (which I reported to you about) has prompted me to share two other aerial sightings I have had in the past. \n \nI am now 61 years old.  I spent my childhood in West Texas, up around Lubbock, Littlefield, Levelland...places like that.  My dad was a school administrator at two small towns, Pep and Bula, which were situated some 50 miles from Lubbock, 20 miles from Littlefield.  I think at least one of them is still on the map. \n \nAs a young lad I often accompanied older farm boys, and my older brother, on jackrabbit spotlighting hunting trips.  I usually rode in the back of a pickup truck whilst older boys with 22cal rifles shot at, and sometimes hit, jackrabbits that we caught in the beam of a good spotlight.  Just drive slowly along any country road with that spotlight sweeping the pastures and you'll catch the eyes of many night creatures there on the high plains of the Texas Panhandle. \n \nIf you've ever seen a Texas jackrabbit run you'll appreciate that this is a most sporting form of hunting, taking a great deal of skill and marksmanship.  There is a quote attributed to Chuck Yeager about country boy's marksmanship...\"give a hillbilly a rifle and he'll hit the bullseye every time\"...or something like that.  Those farm boys were good shots.  I got pretty good myself as I got older. \n \nOn two occasions I witnessed \"green fireballs\" flashing across the night sky.  One I recall distinctly was traveling roughly southwest to northeast.  Being a young lad who read science texts avidly, I just thought to myself \"well, that meteor must have had a lot of copper in it\".  I thought this, of course, because I knew copper oxide is greenish in color. \n \nYears later, while reading a paperback coauthored by Kevin Randle, I read an account of many sightings of green fireballs in the US.  Some, it was reported, had their likely trajectories calculated to predict impact sites--but no debris was found. \n \nSo they say. \n \nI saw at least two of these about 50 years ago, while riding in the back of a pickup truck underneath the brilliant clear night skies of the Texas Panhandle. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

    "text": "A craft with a portal \n \nNOV. 28, 2009  I have been wanting to tell someone about my sighting for a long time, not because I saw a UFO but because of pieces of information that may have some significant value. \n \nThis was in the late 60's in California.  I was maybe 15 at the time, living with my parents. I was sleeping, in my own room at the rear of the house, when I was awakened by a noise.  It was the sound that a jet would make, however it was of a slightly different pitch, I knelt on my bed looking out of my window and was frozen in place by the sight of a UFO hoovering approx. 100' above our neighbors and our house.  This UFO was the stereotypical UFO for the time and I am not sure that I could even describe it accurately now.  This craft hoovered maybe 15 seconds in this spot ( which seemed like 15 minutes ) and then it departed in a vertical direction until it was pretty high, before moving horizontally.  The next thing that happened was pretty cool.  It was a clear night with a lot of stars visible and I was watching this craft depart out of frozen, excited, curiosity.  It was traveling horizontally when it came to a spot in the sky that was pure black, no stars, and darker in! color than the night sky, as it got to this spot it turned into it an vanished instantly. \n \nI was disappointed that it was gone because I wanted to continue to watch and follow this craft, but I was excited because I felt I knew a little something that others didn’t, and that was an explanation of how they are able to travel such great distances.  I have told very few people of this sighting because they tend to not believe you, and I have never really known who I could give this information to. If this information helps in any way than my job is done.  Thanks. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

It was very high up and after some years passed, I kind of dismissed it. Then, about ten years later I was walking with my three year old son in a park in a neighboring city and saw the exact same thing, only this time the craft was much lower in altitude and there were three of them. These craft were moving slowly across the sky. They were exactly the same  as the original ten years prior. Two of them were close and a third was farther away from the other two. The single one seemed to be leading the other two. They were all the same. Silvery, almost looked like a drop of mercury if you broke open a thermometer. Rounded edges, not like a saucer but more like a mushroom top. Only smooth and sheeny. They reflected alot of light like a mirror or highly polished aluminum or chrome. These sightings were ten years apart and exactly the same kind of craft. They were silent and seemed to produce no exhaust of any kind.

    "text": "First off, I apologize for the length of the \"report\" however, it took quite sometime for me to actually be interested enough to find out where/how to make a report.  Mainly, I have heard many stories in my life of ghosts and UFO's.  I'm not one to believe everything I hear.  Until recently, that's been my view.  So, skeptic?, absolutely, believer?, still working on that one. \n \nHere is my past, I've been in the Marine Corps for nine years and 8 months.  I am an operator of a type of Amphibious Assault Vehicle. Google: AAV for more information.  Deployed to the Asias, Iraq and several Floats (stationed aboard Navy Ships).  During these times, I have literally flown in every single type of helicopter that can carry a human being, CH (Cargo Helicopter).  Due to my type of \"Job\", I have come into contact with most AH (Attack Helicopter)types.  Reason why I'm saying this is, I know how they sound.  It's kind of a show-off technique that I can name most Helo's by the sounds of their rotors.  Each one, each type, each speed approximately can be relatively determined by the the sound of the rotors and how many rotors they have.  I can also fairly judge the distance and estimate where and abouts their \"buddy\" is, since no single helo can fly alone, there is always a buddy located nearby.  \n \nAlso, I know what loud vehicles sound like, sounds can identify many things without seeing them.  My times in Iraq fine-tuned my ability to identify sounds, especially while on patrol.  All this being said, here is my account of what I have seen and heard of through my military career. \n \nDuring MCT (Marine Combat Training), approximately 15101999 0200, we experienced an earthquake. My instructor was livid in the morning, his truck which he had parked off the side of the road was rattled off the cliff.  Yes, a cliff.  You can imagine the pain we experienced that morning, he was quite mad.  Later on that evening, the instructors were commenting on the report given by the firewatch during that time.  Apparently, a helo came hovering by at a rapid speed.  When asked how fast, \"it was fast\" was given the answer.  Now consider, the Marine was probably 18 and never exposed to such things until then.  So \"fast\" in Marine terms: It was flying at ridiculous speed.  I know, I was young once too and would have said the same thing.  Also, he said it made weird sounds and was close enough he could have thrown a rock at it before it dipped into the valley.  Camp pendleton has numerous valley and hills.   \n \nLater that day, when asked, no one felt the earthquake and still, no one has really been able to explain how the instructors truck was pushed off a cliff sideways, when nothing else moved nearby.  I would think that if a truck could be rattled and shaken enough to move it sideways, things around us, such as ourselves since we slept on isomats on the ground would have moved also.  I think I would have awoken when I felt another man pressed up against me!  At the time and still to this day, it's a funny as hell story. Looking back though, it's always intrigued me just how...odd it really sounds. \n \nNext account, jets don't fly over pendleton unless it's when the President or another very high staff member comes to pendleton.  Due to the runways limited size here, it's a helicopter Air Wing, few planes land on the runway.  Mainly small jet type passenger planes.  So, when something flies over your car, on Basilone road, at the speed of a jet, you take notice.  Especially when it's about a hundred feet over your car.  Basilone road is a road that cuts through base from I-5 to vandergrift rd.  A very long and lonely stretch of road at 2 am in the morning.  That's what time I was Designated Driver to 2 friends coming back from the bar.  This was around Christmas time the same year as the one account prior to this one, 1999. \n \nNext account, a close friend borrowed my car to go see his girlfriend in San Clemente.  The drive from Oceanside to San Clemente is about 20-25 minutes on the I-5.  When he came back that night to give me my keys, he said the strangest thing happened, a bright green ball of light flew along the coast, up and over the car, then headed back over to the coast, the entire time heading in a northerly direction.  He said it flew way faster than a helicopter and when it was about 1000 meters off to the side and in front of him, the thing just \"took off\".  Faster than he had ever seen anything go. His girlfriend, now wife, said exactly the same thing and she was \"totally freaked out\".  On a side note, the stretch of highway has few lights where this happened.  What lights there are, do not reflect green off your windows.  That was my first assumption until driving down the same highway several times over the years, at different times, and I have NEVER seen any type of green light reflection.  Only yellow or white. \n \nIn Okinawa, Camp Schwab, I was snorkeling with several friends at Naha island, about 1000 meters from shore.  I'm sure Naha Island is not the actual name, just our name for it. Naha means south.  There is an area on this island where it's covered and is quite cozy and perfect to have a sort of camp fire party.  In other words, it's canopied and we could have a fire and get very, very drunk without anyone seeing us or caring to swim out there to investigate.   \n \nAround midnight, some of us went to the closest cliff to \"relieve ourselves\".  The cliff faced away from base. While, doing this, one of my buddies who was apparently gazing up at the stars in a slight stupor, pointed out, \"Holy shit man, you see that?\"  Yes, that is exactly what he said, still funny to this day. We all looked up and about 2000-4000 meters above us,  It's sort of hard to judge distance slightly intoxicated, there were three lights spinning but not spinning...it was like they were rotating about 45 degrees and back again but 75 degrees that time.  Thinking about it now, I don't think it was rotating as in parallel to the ground but was an illusion.  I think now that it was more or less tilting in different directions. What ever it was, if the lights were separate craft, I have never seen helo's do that in such perfect unison.  Odd thing was, it didn't just \"shoot off\", it moved slowly away from base, over the ocean until it was gone. \n \nNext account, flying back from Okinawa a few years later, around 2003, I looked out the window of the plane and saw several objects off to our left moving the opposite direction of us.  Probably around a mile.  Could have been planes.  They had to have been larger than C-130's and were definitely not passenger planes, unless they fly escort for one another.  Reason why I know they weren't C-130's, they were large.  Huge would be a better adjective. While in Iraq, I did see a Hercules plane. That was about how big those craft were.  Could have been that but still, I'm pretty sure I would have been able to see the shape of the wings.  Those planes are massive. Either way, I thought I would include this one since it is a iffy situation. \n \nNext account, Al Anbar Province, Iraq. I was on a night raid in a village in Bubaydah. I'm sure that spelling is incorrect. I was in the turrent of a Humvee. My LtCol asked me what the hell are those Helo's doing here. This was a very important operation, Helo's do not fly close to a \"snatch and grab\" for obvious reasons. My captain got on the hook and radio'ed whoever it is they radio to find out who and why someone was compromising our mission. Radio reply was they didn't know but be advised, jets are inbound. Bebeydah is very very close to the Syrian border, cause for alarm was very just. I was watching the light for about 5-10 minutes. During that specific time, it just sort of moved around, like it was searching for something. It was about 5 miles distant, 1000 meters altitude. It was bobbing and weaving. Acting much the way a Helo would during a sweep mission. Then I noticed, where is his buddy? If it was a Cobra, a Huey would be flying at a higher altitude and a little distance. If it was a \"Huey, then the cobra should have been able to be seen around it. Cobras are difficult to see unless their light is facing you and at that distance, it would have to face us for us to see it. It could have been there. That's what I was thinking. When the jets arrived, thankfully not over the city, they closed in on the Helo. I swear to this day, I saw them shoot rockets at it. I saw four contrails following the glow of four rockets headed straight for it. I know what rockets look like at night, you can see the smoke through the burn of the rocket, it lights it up, hard to explain typing but, I know what a rocket looks like. When those rockets got close to the Helo, they just lost power and fell. Still moving forward, I'm sure of that, inertia and all but, it was the craziest thing I have ever seen, the burners just stopped, when that happens, usually an explosion can be seen, not this time. They just winked out. When this happened they were about 3 miles away. The Helo, and I'm calling it that because, it could! have be en at this point, started chasing one of the jets. Not really chasing it because it would fly in front of it, behind and then under it. I then realized, this wasn't a helo. Helo's don't fly as fast as a jet, especially maneuvering like that. Common sense does replace rationality eventually. After about 3 minutes of this \"taunting\" it flew off. Simple as that, no explosions, only sound was the jets. Eventually, they took off back to where they came from. This occured in 2006. \n \nSo, that's my experiences. I have heard of many many more. Specifically the lights that follow you and pass you on the I-5 going to LA. I've heard probably 10-20 accounts of that. As I said, I'm a skeptic. Not really one to accept an explanation without hard facts but, I also know, if the facts don't add up, then how do you explain it? I've seen some odd things and usually at the time, I blow it off. The incident in Iraq pretty much made me reassess those situations that I kind of didn't really care about the first time. Thinking back, I should have looked a little closer and took notes a little better. So, I think you should possibly check into sightings over Camp Pendleton, especially along the coast. On another side note, my fiance was telling me about how she saw a craft rise out of the ocean from her house. She on the other hand, fully believes in greys, white's or blues, whatever color they are referred to as. She is a conspirasist to the utmost degree. Needless to say, I really don't take her seriously, but, she apparently has seen some things while living in Carlsbad that she explains as UFO's. She also said something about Illinois but I hate to say, I kind of tune her out after awhile. \n \nThank you for reading this and I hope it somewhat helps you out. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

    "text": "Massive silent black triangle over Kosovo \n \nI am an ex British army soldier and have been interested in this phenomenon of \"black triangles\" since encountering one whilst on tour in Kosovo in 2004. I'd just like to share my version in a hope it helps shed some light. On the night it happened I was outside our temporary accommodation at a site we were sharing with the Russian army. I was sitting at a table on a patio area we had knocked up watching a DVD on a portable player. \n \nThe night was very clear and warm. Most of the other lads were either at the gym or the bar. Shortly before the event I was joined by a mate (I don't remember who unfortunately) who sat down to watch the DVD. \n \nAt some point I leaned back on my chair and stretched my arms out behind me facing straight up at the sky. When I did so the first thing I remember seeing was a big patch of \"starless\" sky. This freaked me out straight away but within the next second it became apparent that the patch was triangular in shape because it was moving. This made me realise that it was not the stars that were missing but something massive, black and silent moving in front of them as at the front of the point of the triangle the stars were disappearing while at the back they were re-appearing. \n \nIt was hard to judge whether the object was small and close or large and far away because of the lack of sound. My initial reaction and with hindsight I would say that it was a massive object simply because of the amount of stars it was blanking out as it moved across the sky and also the speed which it travelled. If it was a small object it was moving FAR too slowly to stay airborne surely. If I had to estimate, i would say that this thing was at least 500 meters and most likely a kilometer wide at an altitude of around 5-8000 ft. \n \nAs it passed silently over the mountain horizon I turned to my mate who was also looking up and asked \"did you see that?\" he replied \"yes, what was it?\". He had followed my gaze at the sky and witnessed the same thing. \n \nThe next day I casually asked my commanding officer if there were any stealth aircraft being flown in the area and he said he didn't think so. I'd seen stealth bombers and fighters before and I know it definitely was not one of those I saw. It had no navigation lights for one thing. \n \nI have only just got round to looking into this and just recently googled \"black triangle ufo\" and was amazed at the amount of reports I found. Although it would be awesome to know it was of alien origin, it seems to me (from what I have read) that it could well be a very secret military transport \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

    "text": "Twin-disc 'pivoting' UFO observed to rapidly cross the skies of Slough, U.K., in 1977/ 1978. \n \nI regret that the incident happened so long ago that I am unable to give a precise date. My experience happened in 1977 or 1978, when I was 15 or 16 years old. I was the only witness. At the time, I was a member of my local astronomical society, with responsibility for co-ordinating meteor observation. Astronomy was a serious hobby for me then, and I was used to observing the skies and being able to identify the normal kind of objects in the heavens, e.g. stars, meteors, planets, satellites, and planes. It was late, possibly past midnight – I often did meteor watches through the early hours. I was doing a meteor watch, alone, and lying on a camp bed out on the balcony in front of my house in Slough, Berkshire, UK. \n \n Suddenly there was an astonishing phenomenon in the sky of a kind I had never seen before, and have never seen since. It was definitely not an astronomical phenomenon or any description of human vehicle I know of. The object(s) crossed my field of vision rapidly, within a second or maybe even half a second, so it was moving at incredibly high speed. It consisted of two discs of light. They moved so rapidly that it was difficult to distinguish whether they were clearly defined discs or whether the edges were diffuse, but my memory recalls my perception as being that they were fairly diffuse. Although the discs were about a third or half the diameter of the moon, they were not particularly bright – certainly not as bright as the moon – but not particularly dull, either. The strange thing about them is that they seemed to be connected in some way, as the two discs seemed to be rocking or pivoting about a central axis as they rapidly crossed the skies, so that the discs would during this rocking process be alternately one further in front than the other. The angle of the rocking from the perpendicular was possibly between 30 and 45 degrees, and during the transit, the discs probably repeated this backwards and forwards rocking motion twice. They were separated by a distance of perhaps four or five times the diameter of the moon. The lights were white, and I saw no colour in them. They left no trail, and the trajectory was practically overhead, and they crossed the whole of my field of vision, until it was obscured by the houses on my left-hand side: I was lying on the camp bed facing perpendicularly into the skies. It was a clear, cloudless night. There was no accompanying sound. I did not perceive anything in the object other than these lights, and at the time assumed that these were two separate objects that happened to be flying together in a formation, but was puzzled as to why they seemed to be rocking backwards and forwards about a common axis. However, in more recent years I have wondered whether they! were bo th fixed to the base of a larger, dark craft, whose base was undergoing this rocking motion for some reason: although I was not able to distinguish any craft to which the lights were joined, because of its speed, and the state of utter shock and anxiety I was in when I saw the phenomenon, it could just be the case that I did not notice it. \n \n I shared this information with my parents, and I wrote a report containing much of the detail above, though I cannot remember after all this time what I did with the report: whether I lodged it anywhere - which I think is unlikely, as the Internet wasn’t yet available then, and I wouldn’t have known where to send it – or more likely, whether I filed it somewhere at home and have lost it in the course of the years. \n \n At the time of witnessing this event, I was very much a sceptic with regard to the question of UFOs: I knew enough about relativity to believe that other stars were too far away for extraterrestrial visits to be possible, given the velocity limit of the speed of light. I was simply forced to abandon my scepticism by what I saw with my own eyes. As mentioned above, I was also used to astronomical observations, and could easily have identified a very unusual but natural object, such as a fireball, or a satellite re-entering the atmosphere. \n \n I have scoured the Internet to find out whether anyone has seen anything at all similar to my rocking twin-disc UFO, but have been unsuccessful. I would be extremely interested to know whether you have ever received a report describing anything similar. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Strange lights above the highway on a stormy night. \n \nWhile driving w/b on Highway 160 out of Las Vegas I saw 2 lights ahead which I thought may have been landing lights on an aircraft.  It was very windy and the sky was completely overcast with low clouds.  As I drove nearer it was apparent the lights, which looked like white globes, were either stationary or moving very slowly above the highway, and they appeared to move apart as I closed with them.  As I passed beneath them, 6 very dim white lights became visible; four in a diamond shape between the globes (closer to the right globe than the left) and then two placed equally distant trailing west.  Unlike the two bright lights, the light from the smaller six looked indirectly lit, like distant windows appear in the nighttime.  The lights were then blocked from view as we passed beneath them.  My wife was with me but was not in the least interested and paid no attention to either me or the lights. Also, on the drive back to Tecopa I was astonished to find my night vision was restored--the halos I'd become used to seeing around oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as headlights passed. It only lasted a week or so, but man was that a great thing.  I don't know for sure that it was associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky, but I do know that my vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before. \n \nI can submit a sketch of the lights' configuration on request, IF I can figure out how to load it into this computer.",

Oval shaped orange glows / craft travelling in sky in slow straight lines \n \nWEIRD BRIGHT ORANGE GLOWING OVAL SHAPES JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT ON NEW YEARS EVE, 31.12.08. \n \nAnd no!! I had not been drinking alcohol to see in the New Year!!!!!  Just pulling the bedroom curtains to go to bed, looked outside (facing towards South) looking and listening for celebration fireworks for the occasion. \n \nSaw to my left (South by South East) 4 very bright orange glows, in a straight line, not line abreast, moving slowly across the sky, but not very high up, about a few hundred feet up, possibly a few miles from my location, as if from the general direction of Portsmouth or the Isle of Wight travelling towards Southampton and the Docks area. The glows were not travelling at high speed but fairly slowly in a straight line, spaced wide apart, so were not fireworks or flares as far as I was concerned. \n \nI had never ever seen anything like this on this planet. They had no flashing coloured lights like you would see on aircraft / helicopters. \n \nI couldn't believe my eyes, as I could not work out what this was. I did not understand it. \n \nI ran outside to get a further look, but when I got to the front of the house, they had gone, .BUT then I saw several more spaced apart to the east coming over the trees at the back of my house, again in slow straight lines generally towards Southampton city area and again, a few hundred feet up in the sky. I could not make out any solid shapes, like metalwork, they were just very bright orange glows. \n \nI ran in to get my girlfriend outside to look with me, but when I returned outside, again they had disappeared, BUT then I saw a few more much further away over Southampton, again travelling slowly across the sky in straight lines, not in curved arcs, until they too suddenly disappeared. \n \nThe sky was clear with a few clouds. \n \nThe glows travelled quite a distance, maybe a couple of miles before disappearing. If they were fireworks / flares then they were of a type I have never seen and how did they travel such distances in straight lines across the sky instead of up and down. The glows were very large, perhaps the size of a craft but very difficult to work out in terms of distance away and true size. \n \nI got annoyed with my girlfriend as she refused to come and look. \n \nThat experience stuck with me for weeks, as it was so ,;extra terrestrial’ as far as I am concerned from my experiences on this planet so far. There was no noise with them either like you would hear from aircraft / helicopters. \n \nSO THAT WAS THE END OF THAT……………………………UNTIL……… At about 22.30 hrs on Monday, 15.6.09. I was driving an ambulance from Southampton to Totton area, along the road towards the Rushington roundabout, having just finished my last job. \n \nI saw ahead of me a few hundred feet up, what I initially thought was an odd looking lamppost light, which didn't match the others along the road. They were bright white, but this was bright orange. I then realised that this glow was higher up and further away in the background, as if over Cadnam area. \n \nI strained to work it out as I continued driving, then realised that it was moving in my general direction across the sky, slowly in a straight line. I quickly wound the window down to see if there was any aircraft noise but it was moving silently AND it was the same type of shape and glow as what I experienced on 1.1.09. as described above. \n \nIt was SO WEIRD that I suddenly pulled up on the side of the road. As I did this it slowly passed directly overhead at a height of about a few hundred feet only!!!!!!! I strained to look out through my windscreen at the top as it passed over, but as it did, I DEFINITELY SAW A VERY BROAD AND FLAT SILVER GREY METAL SHAPE OF SOME SORT OF AIRCRAFT WITHIN THE VERY BRIGHT ORANGE GLOW. THIS WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR A HELICOPTER AND IT HAD NO FLASHING LIGHTS AND NO ACCOMPANYING NOISE. \n \nI jumped out of the ambulance to see if it was still above me but it had passed by and I saw it continue moving slowly in a straight line away from me towards Southampton. Again, I could not believe my eyes. The colour and shape of the glow was the same as at New Year. I could not work out what I was seeing, but it was MOST MOST MOST DEFINITELY A FLYING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I jumped back into the ambulance and continued to drive now along the A326 towards Fawley. I looked out and saw the orange glow now a much further distance away and higher up in the sky but it was now moving in a slow straight line as if towards Romsey from Southampton. Then it disappeared. A couple of minutes after this, I saw it again, but this time it was high up again, but moving from the general area of Southampton Docks, south and east as if towards Portsmouth or the Isle of White along the line of Southampton Water. I never saw it again that night. \n \nI cannot say whether it was the same craft on the three occasions seen this evening, or whether it was three craft in different locations over the area. \n \nThis occurrence has stuck with me ever since, BUT THE FANTASTIC THING IS….on the radio the next day (WAVE 105 F.M.) I heard reports that other people had seen these orange glows in the Solent sky that same night before, SO I WAS NOT GOING MAD as there were other witnesses to it!!!! However, the report stated that this was being written off as a meteor shower!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought meteors were small white momentary streaks in the sky, like shooting stars up in space!!?? WHAT I SAW WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT A METEOR SHOWER, BUT A REAL LIFE EVENT INVOLVING A MOVING CRAFT OF SOME SORT!!!!!! DID ANYONE ELSE SEE WHAT I SAW???????????????????????????? I know what I saw and witnessed and I believe in U.F.O.s. \n \nThe human race in my opinion would be very naïve indeed, if we think that we are the only living life forms in the Milky Way, Galaxy, Solar System, Universe etc etc. \n \nIf such craft as reported as being seen moving at incredible speeds across the sky exist, then that suggests to me that they are also capable of travelling FAR FAR greater distances in speed and space than we have so far achieved from this planet. So I reckon that far superior life forms on other planets we have not yet reached in travel, can reach us already!!!! Reporter is a retired police officer and current ambulance driver.

(Yes, there were fireworks going off and no, these were not fireworks!) As a bit of background, I've been a Police Officer for 17 years, all of these being on operational duties.  I served in the Royal Air Force for six years and I have a life long interest in aircraft, thanks to my father.  I would say that I am very knowledgeable about aircraft types.  I am always looking up at aircraft so I am used to seeing things in the air. \n \nJust before Midnight on 31st December 2008, my wife and I went into our loft room in order to watch the fireworks going off over Cardiff.  The velux windows in the loft face north and we had a view of 180 degrees from west to east.  The weather was dry with a slight haze.  Even with the haze, visibility was good. \n \nAt about 00.05 hours, I saw an orange coloured ball of light over the west of Cardiff.  I would estimate that it was about 3 miles away from my position and at a height of about 5000ft.  There were no strobe lights on this object and it moved at a steady pace from south to north, in a straight, horizontal line.  It was in sight for about 10 seconds before disappearing, and it did just vanish from sight as there were no objects between it and me to obscure it from view.  When I first saw it, I pointed it out to my wife who watched it as well. \n \nWithin about 5 seconds of the first object disappearing, I saw another one, this time directly in front of my position so it was over the north of Cardiff, at about the same height but I would estimate at a distance of 2 miles.  It was exactly the same colour as the first and moved from east to west, again in a straight, horizontal line, remaining at the same height.  It remained in view for about 10 seconds and then just disappeared, like the first one. \n \nWithin 10 seconds, I saw yet another object, exactly the same as the first two and exactly the same colour.  This one was above my position and was moving from east to west.  It was bigger than the first two and I believe that it appeared so because it was at a lower height.  Again, it moved in a straight line and was visible for about 5 seconds before vanishing.  Also again, there was nothing that could have obscured my view of it such as a building it could have flown behind etc. \n \nAt this point, my wife decided that she had seen enough and went downstairs and, unfortunately, I had to go with her.  The sight of the lights had spooked her. \n \nI have mentioned these lights to colleagues and one of them put forward the Chinese lantern theory but the lights just appeared, travelled in a straight, horizontal line and then disappeared.  They were in three completely different places and they did not have the flight characteristics of a floating lantern. \n \nThese things weren't travelling at a high speed.  I would say the speed was about that of a helicopter.  In fact, when I saw the first light, I thought that it was the Police helicopter but the colour of the light and the widespread locations as well as the complete lack of any strobe or other flashing lights on the objects soon dispelled that idea. \n \nI have no explanation regarding the identity of these lights.",

It was very strange Huge Orange light flying very slow about 30 km/h and very low, about 50-60 meters in the sky.. It was making NO Noise whatsoever. It was NO some chinese lamp, or some fireworks.. Me and my family of 6 was looking at it. WE NEVER sow something like that.. it was flying over our house in Beaumont, Artane, in Dublin. I hear my neighbours also asking them self what was that...?!... \n \nThis is our 1st time to see something like that.. We are 100% sure that this thing was something out of this world!!! It has disapear in mater of second in the sky... \n \nThe next day I have search the google to check did somebody else sow it.. and it was there many people who sow the same Orange light. some of them claim to have so 2 orange light. I also find the Report from Australia from 03/01/2009 who sow the same Orange lights and also the Australian Army jets have chasing them.. \n \nThe Report says:  \"MILITARY exercises may explain sightings of a mysterious orange light in Central Australia in recent days. \n \n   Military exercises spark UFOs  The Northern Territory News understands a group of people who live at Ali Curung, an Aboriginal community not far from well-known UFO haunt Wycliffe Well, had seen the strange phenomenon from their front porch at about 4am on Saturday. \n \n Several of the group watched as a huge orange ball hovered for an estimated 20 minutes before being chased by what appeared to be four fighter aircraft. \n \n Wycliffe Well owner Lou Farkas said some mentioned their UFO experience the next day when they came in for coffee. \n \n \"They had all just come in on a bus from Alice Springs and none of them had been drinking,\" he said. \"Apparently the light hovered for a while and then three other objects that looked like fighter planes trailed it and were joined by another plane. \n \n \"Then the orange light just disappeared into nowhere - they thought it was quite unusual, especially with the other lights that appeared to be aircraft joining in.\"  Advertisement: A US military spokeswoman said it was quite possible the stargazers had witnessed a military exercise. \n \n  Story source www.news.com.au \"  The photos on the story was the same light we seen.

    "text": "Regular, almost nightly sightings of bright star-like objects and one large slow flying object with red light \n \nFor the past several weeks, I have noticed the following at regular intervals—almost nightly: At least two objects. One is an extremely bright star- looking object that moves slightly  (my perspective). It is not a plane, helicopter or other familiar flying object. Always at the same time another enormous, slow- and low-flying object circles above my house and neighborhood. It is low enough to view pretty well as it has a red light that flashes quickly while it is moving. You can only tell that it is large when the light flashes, but I cannot tell the shape. It is either completely silent or makes an unusual humming noise. My landlord prefers me to smoke cigarettes outside, so I usually am in and out of my house. It is almost always between 7:00 and 8:00 pm in the evening and has gotten so close at times while I am watching it, that it scares me and I run back into my house. Sometimes there are several of the star-like things in the sky, but only one of the large objects, and only one of the star-like objects is closer than all the others. The one that appears the closest is always in the same vicinity. After reading some of these posts, I realized I am not alone in what I see.  I am a little embarrassed to ask any of my co-workers, etc. if they see what I see. I live alone. I took two pictures with my camera phone but they just look like dots. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

    "text": "Round Shaped object had triangle pattern lights under carriage, the top had a series of  lights in circle. Object stood sitll in air. \n \nJanuary 1st 2009  I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette before heading to bed. I remember checking my watch because I knew I had to be up early and head out of town the following morning and I recall it was approximately 11:15 p.m. or so. I was standing out on my front porch smoking a cigarette staring at the tree tops which I often do and noticed a light which was yellowish white in color off in the distance. It was behind one of the trees in my neighbor across the streets yard and at first glance I assumed it to be a star. I noticed slight movement which I assumed was from the tree swaying but the light seemed to be getting closer. \n \nWith an airport within 15 minutes away, it was not uncommon to see planes flying over head so I thought nothing of it. As I continue to smoke my cigarette, the light was moving closer and was ascending. As the object got closer, something told me to take a picture. I pulled out my phone and attempted to with the phones camera, but because of the night the only thing that appeared in the picture was the light (I have the picture archived on my phone). By the time the light reached over were the tree was, it maneuvered in what I can best describe as a half circle or moon shaped movement to the left. \n \nStill ascending upward, I was able to see the undercarriage or belly of the object. There were lights in the shape of a triangle under the object that were in some sort of series of blinking. The lights were red and a very white crystal light. I am still assuming at this point that the object is a plane. \n \nWithin what seem to be a minute or so, the object then made another maneuver in the same half round or moon motion coming back around to the right in the direction of the tree I had first initially seen and maneuvered past the tree over to my side of the street a few houses to the right. At this point the object had descended and I was able to see the top of the object. \n \nThe object was round in shape and had a ring of lights on the outer edge. The object sat in the air still almost as if it was starring at me. I opened my front door and yelled to wake my daughter off the couch to get her mother. Not very comprehensive from being awoken, rubbing her eyes, I directed her to get her mother yelling its important hurry. She came back and said mommy was sleeping. I yelled for her to wake mommy up now! The object is still sitting there while this is transpiring. Finally I dart into the house to wake my wife and fly out the back door of our bedroom onto my deck in the hopes for her to come see what I have seen. \n \nStanding on my deck, I saw nothing. I then run through the house back out front in hopes it was just out of visibility from the deck, but it was gone. I checked my watch and it was 11:28 p.m. After it was all done I was a little shaken by what I had seen. I was telling my wife of the experience and in telling her about what I had seen, my memory recalled that I did not here any engine noise that you typically would from a plane, and of course it was not a helicopter. I have always been quite the skeptic when it comes to the sightings, but I know I saw something I had never seen before and was unable to identify exactly what it was. \n \nI am a 28 year old male, married with 2 children. I am originally from Long Island, NY and moved to NC in 1999. I am a district manager for a men’s clothier and well respected by friends, family and colleagues. People whom know me would attest to my credibility.",

    "text": "Triangular shaped object flying very low to the ground over my parents yard in rural Illinois. \n \nMy two children & I were leaving my parents house in rural Patoka.  As we walked outside, we saw this huge triangular shaped object in the sky not much above the tree tops.  The object made no sound & was travelling extremely slow (almost hovering).  I yelled down for my parents to come outside.  As we all stood their watching we could see the object very plainly, as it was flying so low.  It was heading north.  It had several very bright lights & the bottom of the craft appeared to be flat.  The rest of the craft was mostly black.  The lights from the craft could be seen reflecting off of the ground.  We actually didn't have a clue what it was, but it was unlike anything any of us had seen before.  It flew north over my parents yard & then over the field across the road going north.  It seemed to pick up some speed when it got to the field, but nothing extremely fast.  My children were 10 & 12 at the time & they both remember.  My mother suggested that night that it was possibly something from Scott Airforce Base.  We all tried to accept that theory, but have since pondered what we saw that night.  We never did report it....I guess we were just afraid everyone would think we were crazy.  I was the documentary on Travel Channel a few nights ago called \"UFO's over Illinois\".  Those officers & other eyewitness were describing the same object we seen in Janurary 2000, so I decided to go ahead & report our sighting.

    "text": "Falling star like light object making erratic maneuvers \n \nOn Saturday, January 10th 2009 at approximately 6:10pm in the early dark evening, I witnessed the following account. \n \n About a mile north before the city of Bountiful, Utah traveling south on I-15, I saw above me through the front windshield a bright white/yellow falling star traveling north to south my same direction. The “star” traveled quickly across the sky then “stopped in mid-air” over what appeared to be the ensign peak area between Bountiful and SLC.  This startled me and I said, “What the heck is that?”. No falling star here as the light then moved back north east over North Salt Lake and made a slow wide circling pattern as if it were going to land. At this point my wife said, “Maybe it’s a helicopter going to land”.  The light then traveled west quickly across the interstate and suddenly maneuvered straight up for about 300-500 feet over I-215 just south of the Legacy interchange. After that it traveled south towards the 7th north exit in west SLC desending at a high rate and disappeared from our site. \n \n I am a private pilot and aware of natural speeds and maneuvers a “normal” plane or helicopter would make, but this to me seemed to fast and erratic in behavior. My wife thought she could see blinking lights around the main light. I could not see position lights only the white/yellow light it emitted from all angles.

    "text": "Blindingly bright lights hovering over Reseda, Ca... multiple sightings? \n \nI was driving on the westbound 101 around 8pm in the Reseda, California area when I spotted a blindingly bright light hovering off to the right side of the freeway. At first I thought it may have been a plane flying in my direction at an extremely low altitude. Then the object began to descend straight down, a small but noticeable distance, and continue to hover over the residential area of Reseda. I turned to by boyfriend in the passenger seat and told him I knew what I was looking at. \n \nAt this time a freeway sound wall blocked our view while I was driving in the inside lane. I quickly shifted to the fast lane and waited for the object to come back into view. The object had to be relatively low in the sky if the sound wall and tree tops could easily block our view. When the object was visible again, all the bright lights had been shut off and now the craft’s anti-collision/beacon lights were blinking, and I could clearly see the outline of the unit under the full moon. Disk shaped, with a protruding top and bottom, with the blinking lights arranged around the widest part of the craft. It looked as though it was made of dark grey metal since it was reflective in the moonlight. \n \nWe had driven around the craft, proving that it was stationary, and decided to circle back to get another look. In the 2 minutes that I was able to circle around back to the craft’s original location, it had moved higher up in the sky and less than a half mile west. We followed the craft by street and observed it, now stationary again, for 15 to 20 minutes. Every now and then we would see the lights on the craft dim and brighten, then descend straight down and hover. On the crafts ”low-light” setting; I could see multiple colored lights blinking at different times. When it began to move further west, we followed again until it was just a small speck in the sky. We decided to finish our errand in Reseda and head home. \n \nWe were now driving on the 101 southbound through Studio City, California at about 9pm when I looked up and saw another similar-looking craft with bright lights hovering over the freeway a little higher than the treetops. As soon as I pointed in its direction, the craft took off heading north over my vehicle. Again, we turned around to head north and follow but the craft had traveled a considerable distance and we decided it was too far. \n \nI believe that I may have witnessed two separate spacecrafts. It is also possible that it was the exact same craft that I saw in two different locations when considering its speed capabilities and the time in between spotting the craft(s).",

    "text": "These objects were not known man made aircraft. \n \nOn January 10 2009, 2110 hrs, I took a break from watching a movie (paused it) and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I enjoy looking up to the night sky especially on clear nights when clouds are at a minimum or none are present (the latter applies to this event) and visibility is excellent. On this night I was smoking my cigarette when I noticed a commercial and most likely civilian aircraft making its aerial maneuvers for approach for a landing at Miami Int’l Airport. This is typical at the area where I live since aircraft traffic is directed through this area for landing approach. I did not think too much of it given the fact that I see aircrafts performing routine maneuvers on a daily basis. On this night, however, I noticed two objects flying through the night sky (no particular shape) in a constant formation on the background (relative to the aircraft making its northward turn) of the commercial aircraft. \n \nThese objects were being displaced at a relatively high velocity (or speed, since their general direction and displacement seemed constant). At first I thought that I was seeing “things” and removed my eyeglasses and cleared my eyes. I went ahead and put my glasses on and saw the objects again. The commercial aircraft had a northward direction to while the objects had a general northwest heading. Military aircraft came to my mind in trying to identify the objects but no audible noises were emanating form the objects and no beacon/strobe lights were visible. Unless there are stop secret military stealth aircraft out there flying hypersonic with silent engines (especially at the altitudes these objects were flying) that the civilian population does not know about, I think this classifies as a UFO event. Furthermore, as they traveled in their direction (by the way, one object was leading the other by approximately a couple of thousand feet,  at approximately a 30° elevation, measured relative to the trailing object) their emitted visible lighting was fading. \n \nI am very skeptical about UFO sightings and associated reports on the tabloids. The main reason is probably because I am an engineer and to me almost everything in life has an explanation through engineering and science. This is the first time in my life that I have encountered a physical event that I do not know what to make of it. By the way, I am certain that these objects were not satellites. I am becoming more convinced that we (habitants of planet earth) are not alone in the universe.",

    "text": "There were two ships, saucer shaped, silver grey..like pewter, soundless, drifting over our neighborhood like silent boats on the water \n \nMy mother and I were returning from grocery shopping one evening.  It wasn't too late, being a school night.   \n \nFrom a distance, my mother and I thought that it was a blimp preparing for an emergency landing.  When we drove closer, we realized it was actually two ships.  They were larger than cars, maybe 15 or 20 feet radius.  They looked like what you would see in a Hollywood movie: disk-like or saucer shaped.  The center seemed more spherical.  They reminded me of pewter or stainless steel - a dull shine.  There were lights going around the outer edge, although now, we can not agree on the color.  The lights did not shine down on anything.  I didn't see any seams, doors or windows.  I remember getting out of the car and thinking that it was all true...all the reports that had been made at that time of sightings in our city.  \n \nThe two ships were just above the two-story homes in the neighborhood.  They made no sound.  I remember only hearing the strange buzz of our street lamp.  It seemed like one ship was following the other, just above our street, just above roof level.   \n \nAt first, I got the impression that they were trying to hide from us...they went down one street, them came back into our view...maybe they knew we saw them and came for a closer look at us.   \n \nI had run into the house and got my father, then the three of us were now out standing on our front lawn with our dog. The two ships slowly rotated, or maybe the lights were revolving around their perimeter. I took a step forward, thinking I would be one of the first humans to meet these visitors...but my father said, \"Stay right where you are.\"  And being only 13, I did.  I wasn't afraid, but the tone in my father's voice scared me.  \n \nWe watched as the ships slowly went down the street, one following the other.  They were over the elementary school I had attended, and for a moment I thought that perhaps they would land there.  But the leader seemed to move forward - like a slight pull or jerk - and then shot off to the right with a streak! of white light.  The the second one did the same thing.  They were gone.   \n \nWe went into the house with our groceries, and I wanted to call the newspaper, or maybe the police...My mother looked very concerned and my father just said no.  He didn't want anyone to think that we were a bunch of nuts.   \n \nThe next day, at school, I told my science teacher what I had seen.  He listened respectfully, since I wasn't the type of kid to be speaking up and never known to lie.  After a few minutes I kept asking him what could fly like that, without sound or air movement or anything...just gliding along like a boat on water.  Of course he said there wasn't anything and then I could tell he didn't believe me and some of my friends were looking at me kind of funny....so, I knew what my father meant...\"Some kind of nut.\"   \nBut it really happened and it certainly peaked my interest in science, especially astronomy.  \n \nI now teach Math and Science courses at the high school level.  I tell my story to my students....but only on Halloween and April Fool's Day....after all, I don't want them or my principal thinking I'm some kind of nut. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I watched this for about ten minutes, same thing over and over. They were very clearly there.

We then noticed another, and another.

They looked to be in a line shape, similar to the Orion's Belt Constellation in formation. They were moving slowly southward, with the center light moving slightly back and forth in between the outer two. After about 10 minutes the most southern one began to flash and drop down toward the horizon. The other two remained for another 5 minutes or so then faded out separately. I thought they were maybe some kind of Flare or firework at first, but it just seemed very strange to me. All three others of my family witnessed the event, along with four of my neighbors. I also called my friend in Spring Valley, and her and her father witnessed the event also.",

    "text": "Triangle shaped craft with three red lights at points hovering over Grants Pass, Oregon. \n \nLate on January first, me and two friends were driving in Grants Pass, Oregon. I noticed out the passenger window two red lights hovering in the sky. It was hovering in the air, much too low for any aircraft that I would normally see. It was dark, and cloudy, but the moon still kept in light enough to see. I watched it for a few more seconds, confused as to what I was really seeing. I pointed in the sky, and asked my friends if they saw taht was well. As we kept driving, we could see it from underneath and to the side. The UFO was a wide triangular shape, with two red lights that sort of blinked at each end on the back. At the front tip was another light, and underneath there seemed to be another light closer to the front. The craft was dark, and thick. It was close enough that I could see the wings were the thick side angles. The craft was sleek, like a jet, but wider then anything I have seen. We all grabbed our cameras and pulled the car over. As we did t! hough, the craft (still hovering in the same spot) begin to rise. We got out of the car and the craft was higher in the sky. Then, it turned to the right while staying in the same spot, about 90 degrees, and begin flying away. It moved away from us fast, and was too far to take a picture. Within mintues we had seen this craft hovering above the city, then turn to face the right in the same position, and leave. No military type craft can hover in one spot and then turn on a dime like that. Another strange thing was that there was no noise that came from the craft, it was silent.",

I looked up and seen what appeared to be an Airplane flying overhead. I ignored it for a few seconds, then looked back and saw that it had seemed not to move. I noticed there were no blinking lights on it, and It also was orange in color. We often see airplanes overhead heading North and sometimes in the East. This was different much slower and no sound. I went and got my Video Camera and started filming. As I watched it, I walked toward the back of my yard and could see another one over the top of my house. Then I noticed they were moving very slowly because as I stood still I could see the change in height compared to the top of my roof. They seem to be five spheres or lights together in an arc. The middle light being the biggest, getting smaller toward each side. As I watched and filmed another appeared coming from the same southern location in the sky moving in a straight line! . I filmed one near the Moon as the other two rose in the sky. Then the one near the Moon disappeared fading out as I watched. Then I noticed as I watched each faded as I watched them get higher in the sky from over the top of my roof to above my head. But I started to realize by the time the fifth one appeared it had rose from the south but was disappearing more to the west and not directly overhead anymore. To me this meant it may have been moving outside of the earth’s atmosphere, and the earth was moving below them. Each faded out to the naked eye as they past slowly overhead. But if I used my night vision on my video camera I could still see them as they faded away. \n \nThis was seen by my wife and two children ages nine and ten. \n \n4-1/2 minutes of my video is posted on Youtube “Objects in sky over Antioch 12:33AM Jan 1 2010”.",

Compared to a clock they were at appx 11:00 and 1:00 with the elongated triangle ending at 6:00. My home is in Mount Helix, Ca about 1/2 mile up Fuerte Drive from the I-8 Freeway heading east, my home is on the north side of Fuerte Dr and I was on my patio facing south.

The entire triangle formation would be covered in length by holding appx 3 fists towards the sky from the two lights above to the one below, the two lights above were appx 1 fist apart from what I recall. They were much bigger than the surrounding stars like the ! size of an airplane light though they didn’t move and hovered directly over my home in this elongated triangle pattern for many minutes, maybe 4-6 from the time we both saw them. I went inside and came back out and saw they had moved toward the west and were still very bright, I went inside to find my camera and when I came back outside they were gone, no trace of them anywhere. It is crystal clear in the sky tonight and I have a great view, they were not completely round, maybe just slightly elongated circles of lights. There was also no audible sound like a plane engine, whatever this was it just hovered for many minutes without making any sound.

    "text": "3 Red Beacons in Triangular Shape above Mount Helix at Midnight of NYE 2010. \n \nMy friend and I walked up to the peak of Mount Helix in Spring Valley, San Diego around 11:30pm on 12/31/09 to celebrate the New Year with short meditations and a wonderful view of the city.  We gathered together in front of the large cross right before midnight and both said some kind of prayer and set intentions for ourselves, others and the world for this next year.  We gathered together all of our negative energy and offered it up with appreciation for all the wisdom we gained from its challenges.  As soon as we offered them up towards the sky, we instantly noticed 3 Bright Circular Red Beacons in a triangular shape in the sky slightly north of our position on the hill.  They were just floating without any sound whatsoever and the light remained constant.  My friend said he noticed some flickering of another color (possibly green and red) as he zoomed in with his digital camera but I did not notice this nor was this apparent to the naked eye.  We thought! they might be helicopters at first but they seemed way too high, stationary, mute and close together to be so.  After a couple minutes or so, they began to slowly float directly above our location and then slightly past.  Their triangular shape began to grow smaller as the Beacons moved closer to each other.  Then, at approx. 12:15am, one Beacon began to move off in the distance towards Downtown SD and the waterfront.  The light eventually disappeared in the distance - again, no sound, no other blinking lights and very high up in the sky (nothing like a helicopter).  The other remained for about 2-3 more minutes.  Then they both began to fade as they seemed to travel farther and farther away from the surface of the earth.  By this time, the lights were in between the constellation Orion and the Blue Moon.  The lights, according to our best observations, did not simply dim and shut off but actually \"flew\" or floated farther and farther away from Earth until they finally dis! appeared from our view amongst the stars.  We did not see any addition al sightings afterwards.  We have short video clips from a Digital Camera of the lights throughout various times while they were present. \n \n I am not sure what they were, but they were not frightening at all.  We both felt it was somewhat of a sign or response to our prayers for guidance that we started the night off with. \n \n I am a 25 year old Graduate Student who lives in North East CT but was born and raised here, in Southern California.

I was not wearing glasses nor could I explain what I saw by finding any reflective surfaces within the field of view. \n \nThree lights, a little larger than a star appears, appeared to the left of the moon (about 3 deg) and were moving as soon as I saw them.  I think the lights were white, but the event was so short that I’m really not sure.  They moved across 60 deg of my field of view within less than 2 seconds from the same inclination of the moon to about 10deg lower.  My view was then blocked by a tree so I couldn’t see where they went.  I walked to where I could see behind the tree and the lights were gone. \n \nThe lights were aligned along the axis of movement, but were slightly out of alignment.  I would have thought this to be a jet except that it was moving way too fast and there was no sound at all.

    "text": "Object appears and hovers, strange maneuvering. \n \nEarlier on in the day, approximately 11:00 a.m., I had witnessed 4 black helicopters in the distance flying north. They are not unusual but I have not seen any flying in formation like this here before. I was on a walk with my girlfriend and we both arrived back at the apt. around 2:00p.m. We were entering the stairwell from the parking lot and I noticed a strange looking large, slow moving object over head. I called it to her attention when we were on the stairs. It was so surreal! No noises, no recognizable shape at first. We both stood in awe and asked each other what it was. It looked as if it were a giant 3 orbed blimp, reddish brown in color. I ran into the apt. and snapped some pictures of it from my balcony. I watched it morph into the familiar classic saucer shape as it flew in a perfectly straight line south to where the helicopters were earlier. It hovered in the exact same spot for about 3 minutes and I took some more pictures of it. It slowly be! gan to lift up from its hover and ascended in a straight, vertical line up high in the sky to a point that it stopped and allowed for a passenger plane to pass by. I took a picture of the plane as it flew by, but the object was not visible for that brief instance. It stuck around for a few more minutes hovering and just like that it vanished. About an hour later, the same 4 black helicopters flew back by in the same area that the object was hovering. I don’t know if there is any significance between the helicopters and the object, but it was very odd. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

Streams of light would come out the bottom at times it appeared to be 4 of them and they did not go to the ground but stopped a ways below the object.

    "text": "4 rings of light accompanied by a single ring of light \n \n1/10/10 Viewed over Pratt, Kansas - Saturday January 9, 2010 - 8:55PM  :  My date  had pointed out the Constellation Orion while we were walking up her sidewalk.   We were then looking upwards towards the Eastern sky when 3 dim but distinct white lights forming an equilateral triangle flew overhead at high speed on about an 80 degree Easterly heading.   No outline of a craft was visible. \n \nThe lights each had appearances more like that of illuminated rings rather than being solid, and the intensity of each ring was about that of a medium star that is easily observable.   If there had been street or yard lights nearby, they probably would not have been visible.  I definitely feel that they were all on one craft of some sort as they did not vary in distance or orientation to each other at all.  As for the size, the palm of your hand would have covered them all with your arm extended.  The diameter of each ring was approximately 25% of each leg of the triangle.  They had already passed overhead when we spotted them at about 75 degrees above the Eastern! horizon.  I’d estimate that they traveled 30 to 35 degrees of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds before we lost sight behind the trees and roof.  The wind was calm and we heard absolutely no sound.   This craft had just went out of sight, when we spotted a single ring of light of the same magnitude and speed following a parallel path slightly to the south.  It may have been slightly larger than the other rings.  Or lower?   My initial gut feeling was that these lights were traveling at an altitude in excess of 10,000 feet with a speed in the thousands of miles per hour.  I have no way to know what the actual altitude was, but they did not appear to get smaller or less brilliant as they passed, so that indicates to me that they were of significantly high altitude. \n \nWhat appeared to be an airliner was almost directly overhead shortly after the rings and the lights on it were much brighter and the speed was slower by many many times.  The temperature was 12 degrees and the stars were bright and crisp, so even thought they were dim, the rings of light were very distinct and stayed at the same intensity for the brief time they were visible. \n \nAdded 1/27/10:  My date read the above and agreed on everything other than she said she thought the rings were visible at least 4 seconds.   I  feel the speed could have been  15 - 20,000 mph if the airliner speed was 600 MPH. \n \n \n((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) \n \n\"4 Rings of light accompanied by 1 ring of light\" should have read: 3 Rings of light accompanied by 1 ring of light \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

    "text": "Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09. \n \nI have lived in various towns South Texas since 1999.  Since 2004, I have worked outdoors most if this time, mostly at night with minimal light pollution from large cities.  I have three separate sightings to report with no specific dates, regrettably.  All I cab say is that the first sighting occurred after 01/01/06 before 2007.  The second sighting occurred between 01/03/09 and 02/20/09.  The third sighting occurred between 04/01/09 and 05/15/09.  The first two sightings occurred while I was working.  The last sighting occurred during my off time.  I will recount my experiences here. \n \nAll three sightings occurred in the rural Texas landscape in between Del Rio, Texas to the west, San Antonio, Texas to the north, Corpus Christi, Texas to the east and Laredo, Texas to the south.  In between these four cities are smaller, rurally populated towns.  Outside of the towns are millions of acres of privately owned ranch land that is inaccessible to few consisting of ranch owners, their families, hunters and in areas closer to the Mexican border, the U.S. Border Patrol. \n \nI’d like to emphasize that this area in between the aforementioned cities is sparsely populated and dominated by private land.  Also, after I had observed the objects in all three sightings, I believed the aircraft to be military.  The cities of Del Rio and San Antonio have Air Force installations.  The city of Corpus Christi has a Naval Air Station.  There is also a bombing range approximately 30 to 40 miles east of Cotulla, Texas on Farm to Market Road (FM) 624. \n \nI will report these observations as clearly and accurately as I can, devoid of any opinion or speculation.  I did mention earlier that I believed these objects to be military, but that’s based on the fact that these events occurred within the triangle of those installations where there are several remote miles to operate in without many eyewitness accounts. \n \nFIRST SIGHTING: I was with a coworker traveling westbound on the FM Road 133 which connects Artesia Wells, Texas (LaSalle County) to Catarina, Texas (County).  Both towns are sparsely populated and are surrounded by dense brush for several miles.  Artesia Wells is a town of probably 20 that is approximately 50 miles north of Laredo, Texas, outside of it’s city limits and maybe 90 miles outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Artesia Wells is on IH-35 in a heavily traveled stretch of highway that is relatively clo0se to the Mexican border. \n \nFM 133 is maybe 15 to 20 miles long and only runs from Artesia Wells to Catarina.  There are no tons in between Artesia Wells and Catarina.  Catarina has a population of maybe 50 or more, if not less. \n \nI am not certain as to the time of year, and do not want to speculate.  I do remember that I initially observed the object approximately 10 miles west of Catarina and thought that it was a low flying aircraft.  This was about 45 minutes before sunset.  Approximately 5 miles outside of Catarina, both my coworker and commented that the aircraft did not appear to be moving.  The object was several miles west of the FM 133 and Highway 83 intersection just south of Catarina. \n \nThe object appeared to be black in color, triangular shaped with no lights or visible markings.  The object did not make any sounds that I could hear.  Also, the object appeared to be hovering.  The object’s hover was not consistent with that of a helicopter in that a helicopter moves up and down and side to side as it hovers.  This object appeared to be perfectly still.  I did not notice and type of exhaust emitting from the vehicle. \n \nMy coworker and I attempted to get as close as we could to the object via dirt roads.  The dirt roads we were on took us due south and not west.  The object appeared to be hovering over brush.  From my position, I couldn’t identify any land monuments to pinpoint the object’s location.  There were only trees and plants below the object.  I still would like to say that my coworker and I were still around about 10 miles or so from the object. \n \nWe watched the object until the sun set.  The object remained stationary for the duration.  My coworker and I attempted to get the object’s attention by pointing flashlights at it and using flashing lights while we were stationary. \n \nAt sun set, the object became impossible to see with the naked eye.  I used night vision goggles to view the object.  With very little sub light being used as a light source, I could clearly see the object at the same location, still stationary.  My coworker observed the object through the night vision equipment as well. \n \nIt was at this time that we left the area.  The object was not visible after sun set.  The object did not appear to have any lights. \n \nSECOND SIGHTING: I was working alone near the Artesia Wells area between the hours of 2200 and 0100 hours when I observed lights in the sky.  I was traveling westbound on a rural ranch road one mile south of Artesia Wells and approximately one mile from IH-35 when I first saw a bright light in the sky. \n \nOn this night, the sky was clear and there did not appear to be any clouds in the sky.  I was I was traveling westbound, a bright light that I can best describe as resembling a headlight caught my eye.  The light was very bright and flashed on and off before disappearing.  There appeared to be lights north of this light’s location; these lights seemed relatively close to the first light. \n \nI observed the very bright “headlight” and the others for only a couple of seconds.  I continued traveling west until I reached IH-35.  I parked my vehicle, got out and attempted to signal the area where I observed the light with my flashlight. \n \nI was at the intersection of IH-35 and FM 133 when I attempted to signal this light.  At this point the light was not visible.  I scanned the sky and observed a high flying aircraft that could have been a plane.  This object was traveling southbound on the east side of IH-35 but crossed over IH-35 traveling westbound.  Shortly after crossing over, the object began to travel north.  It took the object between 8-12 minutes before it disappeared out of sight due to distance.  Another aircraft appeared to be several miles behind it. \n \nI turned my attention back to the west sky where I observed three high hovering objects.  These objects appeared to be in a triangular formation.  I could not make out any shapes or sizes.  The lights on these objects appeared to be consistent with conventional aircraft.  They omitted a white beacon every couple of seconds or so.  These objects did not appear to have the typical red port side light or green starboard side light that many aircraft and vessels have.  They remained stationary for several minutes, flashing. \n \nI attempted to signal these objects as well, to no avail. \n \nTo characterize the initial object, I’d say it was about the size of a military flare.  I did not emit smoke and a shadow like military flares and did not appear to be descending under a parachute like a military flare.  It is best described as a single vehicle headlight in the sky.  This object was not a radio or cell phone tower light and was not a vehicle.  It was too high in the sky to be mistaken for vehicle. \n \nThis entire experience lasted about 30 minutes. \n \nTHIRD SIGHTING: On this particular evening, I was traveling home from a shopping trip in Laredo, Texas with my family when my daughter, my wife and I observed an object in the sky.  I was at about the 27 mile marker of IH-35, two miles south of the Border Patrol checkpoint when I observed 4 to 5 bright lights, lined up within three to four times their width from each other.  These objects appeared to be in a much disciplined formation.  These objects appeared consistent with the object I saw in my second sighting.  The objects were very bright and appeared similar to headlights.  They flashed off sequentially, starting with the southern most light.  These lights were in the western sky. \n \nI immediately notified my wife and daughter and they too saw the lights.  I did not stop to investigate or signal to them.  I continued traveling northbound until arrival at the Border Patrol checkpoint. \n \nThe 27 mile marker is approximately 27 miles form the Mexican border.  The lights appeared to be hovering over rural densely brushed and sparsely populated ranches.  There are no major towns or cities northwest of Laredo, Texas that would line up directly west of the 27 mile marker.  The nearest town would be Catarina which is several miles north of Laredo on Highway 83.  The next nearst town would be Encinal, which is 39 miles north on IH-35. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Multiple Orange & Red Spheres Over Southern Mexico \n \nI was celebrating New Year's Eve with a number of other people in a restaurant near my home.  We all saw a bright orange light moving roughly from west to east, and we stopped all of our festivities (musicians included) to watch.  The fireworks for the evening had ended several minutes before. The sighting took about 4-5 minutes before the sphere was out of sight.  It flew (floated) directly over the restaurant. I estimate its height to be no more than 4,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared small, maybe a few meters across, and, just like last year's sighting, emanated a fuzzy orange color that looked a lot like a plasma.  There was no sound, and several other attendees said they had also seen the same kind of event last year. \n \nFrom there, I walked back to my home, and continued to look for more orange lights.  I wasn't disappointed.  I sat on my rooftop, and after about 5 minutes, another orange sphere came from the north and traveled almost exactly south, until it was out of sight.  It floated quite a distance away over the ocean.  So from where I live, I was looking directly west.  There was no sound. About two minutes later a third orange sphere, this time maybe 300 yards closer to my home, floated by, north to south. Again, no sound.  These orange spheres were then followed by two red spheres, each about two to three minutes apart, and each one slightly closer to my home, by what appeared to be equal distances.  It looked as though they were all following a specific north to south direction in a grid pattern, all of the objects acting together. \n \nIf I take all of the spheres as one complete sighting, then the sighting lasted a total of about 30-35 minutes.",

    "text": "Object captured in camera on new year eve fireworks photography assignment for the press agency \n \nI was going for my photo assignment during the new year eve, heading  towards a resort hotel to cover the fireworks display. I position myself at a Tungku Beach facing the hotel from far so that I can frame the fireworks and the hotel all in one frame. When I was there and the fireworks exploded and I started firing shots with my camera using a cable release connected to my Canon EOS 5D digital camera + Canon 70-200MM F2.8 IS (L) lens and a Manfrotto tripod stand. The firework started exactly 12.00AM (+0800GMT) at The Empire Hotel and Country Club and lasted for about 20-30 minutes. Without checking my LCD screen on my camera as most of the shots were burst frames, I left the area. When i was processing the RAW images captured from the camera I realise there was one shot which had something appearing on the left side of the screen so I zoomed in to see what it was. I was shocked! In the image, the object seemed to be hovering above the water and it looks as if it's not too far away from us. Strangely...the object wasn't being seen with my naked eye when I was there. Thousands of people gathered around the same area to view the fireworks. If i were to see it , probably the others would have saw it too however it wasn't visible as it was quite dark from our view. My eye were also drawn towards the fireworks and the hotel so I didn't notice it as it seems like the object positioned itself at a darker area (can be seen in the photo using long exposure to capture the ambient). \n \nThe news had made frontpage in our local news paper.   \n \nLink:  http://www.brunei-online.com/weekend/news/jan3h4.htm \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft, we believe.

Their altitude was just above the tree tops and they were flying in perfect formation staying the same distance from each other through the whole sighting.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and there was little to no wind blowing. \n \nAt first we thought that it could be that they were coming from a Roman candle since there were some fireworks being set off at the time (it being just after midnight at the New Year), but these objects were flying too perfectly and stayed at the same altitude the whole time. \n \nThe light from these objects stayed at the same intensity throughout until they finally faded away at the horizon, and there was no sound. \n \nJust as the first two objects disappeared another two appeared from the southeast (the same direction as the first two).  These two orbs were identical in size and shape to the first two.  They were flying a little farther apart from each other than the first two (it seemed about twice as far), and the first one of this second two objects to appear was flying at a little higher altitude than the following object.  Again these two orbs flew at the same speed as the first two and stayed at the same distance from each other and at the same altitude throughout the sighting.  Also the intensity of the light from these objects was the same as the first two and similarly did not vary until they just faded away as they reached the horizon. \n \nThe entire time of the sighting from the beginning two objects to the time the last two disappeared lasted a little more than five minutes. \n \nWe were so much in awe and did not want to miss anything, so unfortunately we did not get any video of this.

The continuous exploding of fireworks last for about 9 to 11 minutes.  At the end of the firecrackers exploding, our attention was drawn to the southeastern sky.

These four objects were red in color and we could not see any blinking lights nor could we hear any noise coming from this group.  They objects were low enough that we should have been able to hear whether or not they were of a fixed wing aircraft or rotor aircraft. \n \nBehind this group of four we noticed two others and either a single or a third group of two objects.  All of the objects were similar in nature in that they all displayed a red light, none displayed any flashing lights. We could not see any color that would be visible on an aircraft; green on one side or a solid white when viewing from the rear. \n \nThe sky was clear as we could see stars and a partial moon.  The wind was blowing from the north.  We had a small fire in an outdoor pit and we were sitting in a semi-circle.  I myself was sitting with my back to the north, viewing the objects coming from the east, heading westward as if to say they were followig directly over I-10. \n \nAs the objects moved slightly to a point past 180 to 190 degrees, the objects seemed to just disappear.  There were no clouds that would obsecure our view of these objects.   The objects in the second and third group disappeared as did the ones in the first group. \n \nMembers of the viewing group includes a 63 year old registered pharmacist and his wife who is a college graduate and her daughter; my 25 year old son, a college graduate and his wife who is a registered nurse; my sister-in-law who is a photographer; myself, a 55 year old retired state police polygraph examiner and my wife a Licensed Practical Nurse. \n \nThere was no-one in the group who was intoxicated.  I had only had two drinks all night.  The only explanation I can give for not hearing any aircraft noise is that our ears were ringing from the fireworks.  However, no one in the group could hear any aircraft engine noise nor could we see any flashing lights.  As we verbalized our observations. \n \nI also submitted an email to a friend of mine who is a dispatcher with the local sheriff's office.  The content of that email was to ask him if any other reports concerning these objects were received by sheriff's office.  At the time of this writng, I have not heard from him.",

Again the lights kept the same distance apart moving at the same speed.  They were the same colour and similar size.  When the three lights reached the same point as the two lights they disappeared.  I went to the front of the house to see if they had passed over but they were nowhere to be seen.

    "text": "lights lit up in sky 3-4 times shooting off to the south in quartzsite city area........................ \n \nI was driving back from california one evening and was approaching the quartzsite city in arizona (30-45 mins from the cali border), i was talking to my mom and told her i would home in an hour and half or two. While i was driving I saw a diesel truck parked on the side of the road, i thought that was weird. but in the far distance i saw about 5-7 lights light up in a row and start spinnig slowly to the right.Then all of a sudden they shot off in the same direction (south) and dissapeared. I immediately called my mom whom i just got off the phone talking with and told her what i saw, she thought i was tired from driving and told me it was most likely some airplanes. I was like that was no airplane! Then It happened again, only with fewer lights and I told her what was happening and she wouldnt say a word. i was like hello??Mom,Mom, are you there?? Hellooo?? She was like OMG! Is anyone else driving around you?? And I was thinking these people have got to have seen what I just saw, I mean You couldn't NOT have seen it.I sped up my driving and was on the phone still and remember seeing some lights and they kept shooting off. The lights would light up in the sky and would linger there for like 2-3 minutes and then slowly spin to the right and the spinning got faster because they shot off pretty fast. I know there is a road in the mountain you have to pass and those lights were on the side of the city  but off into the distance more south. I was litteraly on the phone with my mom the rest of the way to phoenix. I just want to write this in case someone else might have seen this or something similar happen, in the same area. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date for the alleged sighting, and does not respond to e-mail.

    "text": "UFO and alien sighting   \n \nHonestly this is not a hoax.  Back in 2003 when my wife and I lived in Mocksville I believe I had an encounter with aliens.  I remembered seeing two very strange looking creatures standing at the foot of my bed!  I closed my eyes and reopened them and they were gone.  I thought maybe I had still been dreaming so I went back to sleep, but it took awhile as I was a little freaked out.  The next morning I got about 7:00 AM to get my shower before I left for work.  When I got in the shower and the water ran down my leg I noticed a burning feeling on the back of my left leg.  When I turned my leg around to see what it was I had a perfect 2\" X 2\" square of hair missing on my leg and it was a little red???  I'm not sure what exactly happened that night, but needless to say it freaked me totally out.  My wife is the only other person I have told about this, because I figured people would think I'm crazy.  About a year later I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.  While using the bathroom I noticed a white light zipping across the sky.  As I began to stare at it, the object completely stopped.  About 30 seconds later it took off again so fast I almost lost track of it.  I got my wife up and showed it to her.  Neither of us had any idea what in the world it could be since there are no aircrafts that I know of that can move like that. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At first, I thought this was a high altitude aircraft which I often see and paid it no mind.  As I got closer to home I noticed that it was pretty big even though it was very high up and seemed to be traveling west.  At that moment my son was pulling into the driveway exclaiming, \"What the hell is that!\"  I told him I thought it was a high altitude aircraft and he disagreed.  He said \"Dad, really take a look at it!  Thats no plane!\"  I told him to run inside and get my binoculars and when he returned with them, the object was farther away and nearing the treeline.  We observed this object, which he was right, was no plane, traveling high and appearing to be burning up in the atmosphere.  It was cylindrical in shape and was bright orange and yellow and leaving a smoke trail behind it.  It also seemed incredibly large in size considering that it was so high up. We couldnt make out any windows or control surfaces such as wings and such, but it was very high and far downrange when we finally looked at it with binoculars.  large object entering our atmosphere and  Also at the time I looked at it with binoculars it seemed to have changed from traveling like a missle, to traveling on its side and like a bar and at an angle so contrails were forming from both its ends.  Very cool looking and extremely odd to see at that time of day.  The sun wasnt exactly setting yet and it was pretty much still daylight outside.

I was just walking for a few minutes and was on the sidewalk of a school, when I saw these flashing lights up in the sky. \n \nI remember the green lights were the color of a green LED such as that you would find on a computer monitor. \n \nI remember I saw one BRIGHT light. \n \nI remember a voice calling saying, \"Drop the tunug.\" It was a robotic voice. I remember calling out, \"I do not have anything in my hand.\"  The voice said again, \"DROP THE TUNUG.\"I started running. I remember praying in my head, \"LORD, I am not doing ANYTHING wrong.. PLEASE save me. I will always serve you no matter what, so PLEASE help me.\"  I remember this horrible pain going through my legs, and I fell to the ground. \n \nI heard a clicking noise. \n \nI remember someone walking up to me. They put handcuffs on me. I was told to get up, and not to move, or I would be shot with a taser. \n \nI know a LOT about tasers. I remember that I was taken to a building. \n \nIt was a building, that i had never seen before. \n \nWhen I got in, I heard the building making a low pitched humming noise, and there were several machines with lines, and other thangs going across their screen. \n \nI was told to sit down. \n \nI sat down in a little chair which had several buttons and cranks on it. \n \nI saw a red button that said, \"For emergencies only.\"  I remember I was told to sit and be quiet or I would be tased again. \n \nI complied. \n \nI was hooked up to a pulse oximeter, which monitored my oxygen levels, and a mask was put on my face. \n \nI remember them saying my oxygen was VERY low. \n \nI was taken to a little room, and was hooked up to an EKG machine which beeped to my heartrate. \n \nI was then told to put my face up against this machine. \n \nI remember my Mom had told me before NEVER to look into something unless I knew what it was. \n \nI refused to do as I was commanded. \n \nThey tased me again. \n \nI told them that I was going to do whatever my Mom said, and that I WOULD NOT do that. \n \nI was told that if I did not do what they said I would be put in a green light. \n \nThey said the green light would not just flash. \n \nIt would shock me. \n \nI did NOt put my face up to the machine. \n \nYou see I am visually impared, and I have to have A LOT of tests, and i am VERY curious when it comes to tests, but I resisted my curiousity. \n \nI was taken into a room, and placed in a little machine. \n \nI prayed, and as I was in the machine I sang praises to God who I KNOW would help deliver me from this machine. \n \nI saw a green light come on. \n \nSomeone outside of the light screamed. \n \nI remember someone grabbing me, and taking me out of the light, and they told me that if I did NOT do what they said, I would be tased. \n \nI was then unhooked from the machines. \n \nI was taken outside and told that I was free to go. \n \nThey put this blue light on me, and everything went black from there. \n \nI then remember waking up in the craft again, and was told that I was going to have a device called a tunug used on me. \n \nThey hooked something up to the wall, and I heard this LOUD noise. \n \nIt sounded like a machine that is used in the eye Drs. I was then told to look at a red light above me. \n \nI DID NOT. \n \nI remember having an urge to do something. \n \nI grabbed something, and pulled it down. \n \nI started pushing buttons on a lever, and everyone in the room screamed at me. \n \nI remember seeing these springs coiled up, and they were green. \n \nThey had a light that was very bright. \n \nThe light was green. \n \nI was told that I was free to go. \n \nI was told that I was not going to get the tunug used on me. \n \nThey took me to the back of the house  or craft or whatever its called, and told me to get out. \n \nI walked out and when I continued walking I saw these green lights on the ground. \n \nI saw a blinking light that said, \"DO NOT Remove any of these green lights.\" \\ I walked passed them, and continued walking. \n \nI then left. \n \nI kept walking, until I turned around and went back home. \n \nThe next morning I woke up, and went to check on these lights. \n \nThey were now just bulbs that were NOT on.",

    "text": "3-4 triangular \"humming\" objects at treetop level in Middletown, Ohio \n \nAt 2am I went to let my dogs out, and saw/heard nothing unusual. I returned to my upstairs bedroom on the front side of our house, and resumed watching television. I had my bedside window opened approximately 6, though my shades covered the gap. \n \nAt 2:05 exactly, my (almost 15 year old) daughter and her friend were in a nearby bedroom talking.  Her bedroom faces the rear of our home.  There are no shades or blinds on her windows.  The girls remarked that there must be a storm coming, as there were flashes visible in the upper edges of the windows, and appeared to emanate from the clouds/fog over the house.  They then realized that the flashes were stationary and occurred in fixed intervals.   \n \nAs the girls looked more closely out the window, they were looking upward.  They noticed that a large dark shape was moving over our 2 story home toward our backyard (west to east).  The dark shape then dipped downward as it moved over the crest of our home toward our backyard (eastward), and was visible below the cloud/fog level, approximately 30 feet off the ground.  As it moved slowly away, it became clear that it was triangular in shape, and had 3 lights along the back, flashing blue, red and green in varying patterns.  The object emitted a low, pulsing hum noise that was audible from the girl’s window.  There were no loud or airplane/jet noises, or I would have heard them with my window open. I can only surmise that between my tv and my husband’s snoring, I was unable to hear the very low noise. \n \nBehind our home is an open field that is used for farming.  It is a large, open area with the nearest houses at least 1/3 a mile away (guessing - not an absolute distance).  There is an old barn within ~200 feet of our home that sits in the southwest corner of the open field.  As the object moved away from our property, it reached the area of the barn and hovered briefly.  It then slowly moved away toward the northeast, and suddenly disappeared.  It appeared to the girls that the object was approximately the width of 2 houses in size. \n \nAt 2:08am, near the far east edge of the field, 2 similar objects suddenly \"winked on\" and moved around one another for a brief period.  They appeared to be the same types of objects as the one that moved over our home. Just as suddenly as they appeared, they seemed to \"wink off\" and disappear. \n \nAt 2:10am, a new set of flashes were visible over the house, and they were similar in nature to the first set. As the girls watched, a much larger, and louder (humming) object moved over the crest of our home, following the same path that the first one did.  This one appeared identical in every way, with the exception that it was so large that as it dipped over our home, the edges were not immediately visible.  It had to move beyond the barn for the entire object to be seen. It was easily double or more the size of the first object.  As it moved west to east, it slowed over the field, and then slowly seemed to rotate over a fixed area, and remained there for approximately 3-5 minutes.  It was possible to see strobing lights on all 3 corners of the object, but the 3 lights in color were only visible on the \"back\" edge of the object. As the object sat in place, the 2 objects that had been sighted at 2:08 suddenly lit back up and began to move around, as if in response to the larger object close to our home.  This continued for the last couple of minutes that the large object hovered.  \n \nWith no warning, all three objects just disappeared. It looked as though the smaller objects streaked away to the left and right of the large one, and that the large object lifted straight up, out of sight. \n \nThe two girls described their thoughts and feelings as though they were transfixed and unable to really do anything but watch.  They debated whether to wake either myself or my husband, but were concerned that they may not be believed, especially after time had passed and no more objects were visible.  The one thing that they did notice was police sirens in the vicinity (I did hear those), and they wondered if they were in any way responding to the objects. \n \nThe open field is sort of unusual in that it is sort of \"land-locked.\"  It has very busy roads on 2 sides, and has houses and suburbs on all 4 sides.  If you didn’t live next to it, you would not be aware that it is even there.  Considering it’s size, that is really unusual. \n \nA very short distance from the field, near the south-eastern corner are at least 3 bar/club businesses and a bowling alley, all of which would have closed at 2am.  If anyone was leaving them (this was a Friday pm/Saturday am time period) they should have been within eyesight of  some or all of the objects.  The only variable that I am uncertain of is the cloud cover/fog placement.  Even when the objects were above the cloud/fog line, the rhythmic strobing was visible. \n \nI have repeatedly asked questions of my daughter in different ways to verify details (and to a lesser extent her friend - she had to leave), and the story has remained consistent.  I believe her - and that was before I had a chance to read/learn about all the other sightings near our area.  We are very interested in verification of the sightings, and if anyone else saw anything similar.  PLEASE get back with us if you learn anything, or we can do more. \n \n[Please Note - Though we don’t want it posted publicly, entering our address into Google Maps will show you the field in relation to our home.  In the lower left corner of the field is the barn and a dark, teardrop-shaped pond.]",

Then one came out of formation to the south and then another right next to it. The last 3 stayed in a triangle formation for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile the first light to move south faded out. After that, the second light out of formation moved quickly in the place of the first and disappeared. There seemed to be a trail of exhaust left by the second light when it vanished.

There were no sounds whatsoever. \n \n While it was getting further away, it was getting dimmer, and the more it seemed to go away from us, rather than passing by, it started disappearing. \n \nIt slowed down for a few seconds, changed direction, and turned again, and resumed at the same speed it was going in the beginning of the sighting. \n \n I don't know what that was, but everyone where we were saw it.

This light show up bellow the Taurus constellation (north-east), at around 20-30 digress above the horizon.

    "text": "Bright light in broad daylight changing intermittently to black object moves slowly across sky in Sant Barbara. \n \nON January 1st 2008 at approximately 11 am. in Santa Barbara California I noticed a bright object in the sky at about 75 degrees above ground level if one were to consider 90 degrees directly overhead. Weather conditions were bright and clear with blue skies and some very patchy, high, thin, hazy and mostly transparent clouds. The clouds were not as high as cirrus clouds but they appeared quite high and were much higher than what one would call coastal haze. \n \nThe brightness of the object caught my attention through the window as it was quite intense somewhat like a bright star at night or the landing lights on a plane at dusk. This was however quite out of the ordinary as it was a very bright sunny day. The object also appeared to be still in the sky. After staring at it for a while and asking my friend to take a look and tell me what he thought it might be  I went outside for a better view. \n \nI was visiting my friend and asked it he had any binoculars but he didn’t so I was left to scrutinize the object with my naked eyes. I am a visual artist and an avid birder so my observation skills are fairly strong. \n \nIt was to the north of my position and the sun would have been to the south east. The object was moving in a straight line from east to west very slowly. I could observe that it was traveling just beneath the high clouds as it would occasionally dip slightly into them. When I was viewing it through the some what dirty window I noticed that it would disappear and then reappear with the same intensity. I thought that perhaps it was becoming obscured by the clouds. However when seen from outside the house I could see that when it was not shining with a bluish light it would turn completely black as in pure black and not at all grayish as it might have been if there were some atmospheric interference. In it’s black phase I got the impression that it was shaped somewhat like a very shallowly curved fingernail clipping with the con caved side down, the convex side up and pointed on the ends. \n \nI am not an aviation expert but I believe I could safely say that no conventional aircraft could fly that slowly except for an ultra light and I don’t think that ultra lights fly at such high altitudes. There was an airliner flying above it and it’s rate of movement across the sky was much faster than object in question even thought the air liner was at a much higher altitude. I considered that if it were an ultra light the top side of the wing might be made of a highly reflective material such as a blue tinted mylar while the bottom was either non reflective or simply not catching the light. In that case it would have had to be changing it’s degree of tilt in relation to my point of observation in order to cause the on and off effect. However it’s trajectory looked straight, slow and steady. \n \nWhen lighted it seemed to be emitting light just like a bright star but I wondered if it might not simply be reflecting the sun. \n \nAs the object moved far into the west and eventually went out of sight it continued to appear as thought the light were emitted from it. Im not sure if anything could change it’s position that much relative to my point of observation and still reflect the sun with the same intensity directly to my eyes. I have never seen anything like it and I’ll be watching for other reports about it. \n \nSome brief info on me: 19 years employed at UPS as receiving counter clerk, 14 years teaching art and music in state prison as a contract teacher for arts in corrections. Well known as an artist and musician in San Luis Obispo. Graduated California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland California 1972 MFA with high distinction, major sculpture. Resided in San Luis Obispo for 35 years. My friend who was cooking breakfast and did not look at the object as much as I did is a well known musician and educator in Santa Barbara. He is a graduate of Cal Poly State University in San Luis Obispo where he received his teaching credential.",

There were no lights and it was flying slow. \n \n Three other people were with me to confirm. \n \nI found this previous sighting below that was very much the same:   \n \nNUFORC Home Page Web Report Indexes: by Event Date | by Location | by Shape | by Posting Date  National UFO Reporting Center Sighting Report  \nOccurred : 11/27/2007 07:34 (Entered as : 11/27/07 07:34)  \nReported: 11/27/2007 5:52:47 AM 05:52  \nPosted: 11/28/2007  \nLocation: Winter Park, FL  \nShape: Unknown  \nDuration:2-4 minutes  \n \nStrange Dark Object over Winter Park  I was standing by Lake Virginia at Dinky Dock Park this morning just after 7:30am. This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area. The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds. There was no wind. The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south. \n \nI was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west. At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake. The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed. As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird. The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn't see any evidence of a person beneath the object. It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area. Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight. There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away. When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I'm not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it. \n \nA few strange things about the object: It seemed to be flying low. It was difficult to determine its exact shape. It was completely silent. It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference. The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I'd say that it wasn't big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it. Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it's possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view. \n \nMy only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon. It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending. Also, the shape seemed to be off. \n \nI'm wondering if anyone else saw this object today. It flew towards a very busy road during morning rush hour traffic - Highway 436 in Winter Park - when I lost sight of it. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I thought it was a cluster bomb or cruise missles at first until I saw the entity looked connected/swarming and to be composed of black triangles. We saw dull red lights blink on the perimeter of it and it seemed to change shape between a rotating triangular mass and then rectangular with imperfect corners. It flew silently and the sun was just setting so there was plenty of light and the sky was completely clear. It was as high up in the sky as a fighter jet and about the size of a football field. We tried to take a picture of it but it didn't show up on the phone. Triangular specks kept coming off of it and then would catch up to it as well. The mass hovered parallel to the horizon slowly and drifted off however relative to its size it was moving extremely fast. Another person I was with said it faded away at a much different time as I continued to see it with another person. It did resemble a balloon or parachute at times until it would break apart into a triangular pattern.

I was going about my business when my friend came running over to my tuck. I said whats wrong and he says \"Tell me what that is.\" pointing to the sky over the treetops. I looked up and saw about 9-10 balls(The sight was so amazing i forgot to count) of light (whitish bluish mix similar to LEDS Just barely could see them though) in a perfect circle similar in size to a moon in the sky when the object was above the treetops. The balls of light were on the edge of whatever it was to form a circle so it appeared. It fluttered around like a frisby or like a leaf falling to the ground or something blowing in the wind (seemed unstable). It would dissapear into the trees then reappear above them for a few minutes at a time at treetop level. We at first thought maybe it's a toy or something but then it rose very slowly thousands of feet up into the cloud cover then came back down then dissapeared into the trees. We then were perplexed by it. We waited for it to come back up but it never did so we went back plowing. I again though on the opposite side saw it popback up and hover in the same area as did my friend. Then it slowly rose up into cloud cover then was faintly visible then dissapeared into the night. I attempted video of it on my camera phone but the light from the school blocked it out so the background just looks black. I know what a plane's lights look like I know what a satelite looks like it was not any of this. We didnt hear any propulsion system as well you could hear the rumbles of passing airliner or jets in the distance here and there but nothing sounded to be comming form the objects direction.

I heard then saw a commercial airliner crossing the sky.  It was very clear and moving fast.  Then I noticed another object flying in an exact opposite path that appeared to be a bit lower.  Its lights weren’t as bright as the planes but it had the same shape and size.  It looked like one object with a light on the nose, wingtips, and tail.  The tail light was red and the others where white.  I thought it was another plane until it moved sideways as it was going forward.  Not turning with the front light staying in front but more like drifting.  It also didn’t make a sound.  By now the jet was long gone.   This really caught my attention.  As it moved away, the lights on either side began to move inward into a single file line, still moving forward with the entire line shifting to the right all at once and continuing on its forward path.  I watched it for a few more seconds and then  it just vanished.  No noise was ever heard from the object. \n \nI am a 36 year old male.  My wife and I own a karate school and a cabinet shop.

I live near the intercoastal so I always am looking into the sky around this time. However, when I walked outside I stopped at stared at a bright white star in the sky but to low to be a star. Im not sure how long it was there, but when i looked at it, it then shot straight down at light speeds and disappeared in mid air.  There was also a stranger in the parking lot on his cell phone. He hung up and we both said, \"What the **** was that?!\" We both stared in shock.  The circular white ball formed into two white balls and looked like a division symbol in the sky.  It had one large dot then a line in the middle and then another dot directly behind the other as it shot towards earth.  However, it looked like it would have landed close to the intercoastal waters or around the area where that scientology church is located in clearwater.  This thing went directly down and had no trail whatsoever, so we ruled out a comet. I am young, in great health and have no vision problems and do not follow scientology or science fiction.  This is one of the oddest things ive seen and has inspired me to do some online research like this.. But what was odd was that, whatever it was, it looked like it would have hit somewhere very close to that scientology building.

This sighting seems more convincing than last posting in that the sparkling object has multiple lights, including a blinking series of lights at bottom and left hand side, almost like flashlight strength from helicopter.  The object's location in sky is right at sea/sky's horizon due east of Satellite Beach, lower and nearer than past reporting.  The movement of the object is small darts or pendulum like swings to left, right and up. \n \n The object is not on the same movement/trajectory up into the sky as was last reported of possible Venus/Mars location.  This object has not ascended but has rather remained in a hovering position at same eye level as a cruise ship that would be on the horizon leaving Port Canaveral.  This is clearly not a cruiseliner, but appears to be circular or some sort of patroling device due to the light projectory twinkling like a star and like it is looking intently for something over the ocean.  It is nearer to the surface and to the shoreline than last reporting. \n \n The movement is more pronounced as hovering or observing than \"ascending into the sky\" with Earth's rotation...it is now 31 minutes into my observation and the object is clearly some sort of craft due to the smaller light on bottom left, and movement resembling that of a darting insect, not a star or planet. \n \n Hope this helps, it's bizarre, and I'm returning to sleep.

I was travelling north on Highway 377. Shorly after starting out north I observed a extremely bright, white light about the size of a motorcycle head light. The flashing light was white and very bright it was moving at the speed of my car just below the treetops. It was about 100 feet from my car and the highway. The flashing light stayed at the same speed as my car. I slowed down to 50MPH and the light slowed down, I sped up to 60MPH and the light stayed even with my car.

I could see the light on the pavement outside my driver's side window flashing. That occured for about two blocks until I had to turn east on Highway 59.

    "text": "1/10/08 Poughkeepsie,NY 20:05 Circular/Sphere with 4 pods 200 feet above ground \n \nI am a registered nurse who does not believe in UFO's and am skeptical about their sightings.  On January 10, 2008 while walking my dog, I saw the following after I had researched all unusually shaped aircrafts and found absolutely none that looked like what I had seen that evening. \n \n  The object was a saucer shape with 4 rounded pods protruding from the sides.  It was white, possibly light grey in color.  Under each pod there were alternating dull red/blue lights under each pod.  The craft was approximately 200 feet above the ground, no sound just gliding.  When it came directly over me, there was sort of an emptiness to the environment sort of a black hole if you will.  It hovered over me for a few seconds then came a sound of the engine revving up.  The space craft then picked up speed, travelled approximately 2 miles then disappeared into the air. \n \n After this incident, I looked up the hill where I was and saw a dark figure with a bright blue light that did not reflect light as a traditional flashlight would walking towards me.  My Labrador Retriever kept looking in the direction of this image and wanted to go towards it.  I ran towards my home all the while pulling the dog.  When I came into the house, the dog ran up the stairs and looked out the window and began to bark incessantly with his hair standing on end.  I no longer saw the image.  I did not want to call the police because I thought that they would think I was unstable.  I am writing to you at the prompting of a few friends who believe this will be helpful.",

    "text": "Saw a plane, bright light beside it then beind it then back beside it a 100 feet or so. \n \nI was hitchiking to Mineral Wells Texas from Goree Texas.  It was very late approx 1 AM.  I was on a farm market road.  There was no traffic.  \n \nI was walking along and looked up and saw a airplane I could hear.  I saw a very bright light flying beside the plane, the plane was a comercial plane.  I watched it a minute or so and looked back where I was walking.   \n \nA few secound later I look back up and it is flying behind the plane.  I looked back down and then back up and it was flying beside it again. The hair on my neck stood up.  I was honestly scared.  I saw a house about 3-4 hundred yards off the highway with lights on.   \n \nI decided to go to it to see if I might use the phone to call my recruiter to come and pick me up.  I had to go over 4 bobwire fences to get to the house.  I knocked on the door and a very harsh voice asked who is it.  I asked to use the phone.  He yelled out you better get out of here before I shoot you.  I didn't waist any time leaving. I crossed over 2 of the fences in a run and as I was going over the third fence I heard shots and heard pellets landing all around me.  From there I cannot tell you anything.   \n \nThe next thing I remember is being in my recruiters car and pulling into his driveway.  I cannot tell you how I got in his car, how I contacted him to get him to pick me up in his car.  I cannot tell you going over the forth fence or getting on the highway.   \n \nWhen we were pulling up in his driveway it was just starting to get light outside.  So I am missing 4-5 hours that I cannot account for.  \n \nI contacted MUFON but they seem to be a joke.  Talked to a man over Skype, can't remenber his name,seen him as we talked.  I told him my story and this thing I have in my body.  It's a tiny spot like a ball.   \n \nThey told me they were putting together a bus with Xray equipment and would come and Xray this spot and see if it might be a implant.  I told him I can show him lights in the sky every clear night that I cannot explain.   \n \nI promise you they are not of this earth.  You can't just look up and see them, there is a way to do it to be able to spot them.   \n \nThese lights do very strange things that aircraft doesn't do.  Like dog fighting,getting extreamly bright and then just vanishing.  Sorry but I don't think planes do that. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

    "text": "slowly moving and rotating UFO at night \n \nI am sorry to come to the point to report the event so much time after it happened... \n \nI live in a village (approx. 2000 residents) 25 km from Budapest.  It was a winter evening (2008 or 2009) around 6 to 7 pm (fully dark). It was overcast with cloud base at approx 100 m (300 ft). \n \nI drove home from work, parked my car in the garage and went up the (outside) stairs to enter my house.  After a few steps on the stairs I could see over the garage and noticed a strange thing. \n \nDim blueish green light sources on a circular pattern, about 10 pcs, rotating slowly around the center, about half rotation per sec.  It seemed as they were on the bottom of a circular object, which is spinning horizontally.  I could not see the object itself, so unsure about its shape, because there was not any backlight.  I could just see the lights on its bottom.  It was about 300 m away from me and with the little reference to other objects (some tall trees) I estimate its diameter to be 15 m, and its altitude 50 m over the land.  There is a main railway line at the edge of the village and it seemed a bit farther than that, over the lands. \n \nIt was hovering, no movement and the rotation was also stable.  The lights were also stable in color and brightness.  First I thought someone was playing with kind of a disco laser light, which would probably project similarly on a very smooth cloud base.  But after about 5 seconds it started to move left (East) in a way what was very surprising to me and excluded the disco light possibility.  \n \nFirst it tipped left about 20 to 30 deg and started to move in that direction.  Then it tipped right the same amount, and continued this slow left-right tipping, while moving slowly to East (50 kmh?), and out of my sight (other buildings, trees and terrain blocking sight). \n \nI told my wife what I just saw and to my workmates next day.   \n \nI am an electrical engineer and have a PPL and tried to identify the object based on my knowledge, but I still cannot explain it. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I also remember saying quick we better check the news, there was a fear of we where being invaded..  there is something chilling about this encounter and as time goes on we are constantly reminded of things, little pieces of this puzzle come back to us with startling reality..  we also have had another dream at the same time as we slept and when we woke in morning we told the same thing to each other that there was something with long fingers coming to get us, we both put it down to Freddy crougar type nightmare..   this Freddy crougar dream happened in my fiancée’s house five years ago. this airborne vision was only 3years a! go .. there was no sound we can remember.. I think 1’m going m! ad.. I u sed to have a good memory , now I feel my short time memory has had something done to it and also I find facial recognition hard  in my short term memory ..I am beginning to think I’ve been brain washed. I periodically have dreams that something is at me or coming for me and I cannot open my eyes, I keep fighting this to no avail . eventually I can open my eyes  . these dreams come on for no reason, I feel helpless and I cannot move no matter how hard I try, its like my eyes are glued shut but I am conscious and aware of something being there. Please let me know if anyone else has experienced these things as we have and I still do.. \n \n I was an auto technician until I hurt myself in an accident, I have an average education, I have all these things in my head about stuff I should know nothing about, I have emailed professor Stephen Hawking about these things,, I am yet to have a satisfactory answer, I have also emailed Ronald Mallett, Professor at the University of Connecticut.. I have yet to get a reply. \n \nI  do not know why I know this stuff or at least know how to question the things I do, I am no physicist. \n \n yours sincerely",

    "text": "Large object moved slowly over the city \n \nThis not a first hand report.  I've had this event in my memory for many years, and I am wondering if any one can substantiate or add detail to what I'm calling an event. \n \nI believe it happened between about '68 and the early 70's.  My father worked as the attendant at one of the few all night gas stations along the old Rt 66 as it passed through Joplin, MO -- locally known as East 7th Street.  The station sat near the crest of a very long up-slope and so at night one could see back across the city quite well.  He was the introverted, serious type person.  Many of the local cops patrolling the city made this station a regular night-shift break stop and they shared all the \"cop gossip\" with him.  He stated to me the following when I visited on a weekend. \n \nOne night he saw an illuminated metallic craft moving slowly just above rooftop level across the city.  The motion was steady and it exhibited a controlled motion.  It apparently did not come directly over the gas station.  This activity continued long enough for several police cars to engage in trailing the craft around the city, as he saw the roof lights on their cars in the distance and heard sirens.  He said that the craft eventually gained altitude and simply faded into the night sky -- there was no sudden vanishing, it just flew off very calmly. \n \nLater that same night, many of the cops converged at the gas station and began relating to each other what they had witnessed.  My father, of course, heard much of the chatter between officers and on the radios.  All agreed that they had seen a very large metal craft that simply glowed with no apparent source of light.  Some reported what appeared to be windows and various details about the skin, much as you might attempt to describe the surface of any vehicle after having been up close. \n \nAfter a few nights, the various cops on duty the night of the sighting resumed their regular break stops at the gas station.  All told my father a similar thing: They had all been instructed to forget that they had seen any thing and to speak no more of it. \n \nDad said that the Joplin Globe Newspaper ran an article on the UFO as soon as they gathered the early police reports, but then the story was never given any additional press by the newspaper. \n \nI repeat that this was told to me by my father years ago.  I buried this for so long that I lost track of when it happened.  I wish that I'd had enough presence of mind to have at least written down the date. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

It passed NW of my location, covering the field of view in 2–3 min. As it moved out of sight, a second appeared in the SW and behaved likewise except that it seemed to pass slightly closer. As it moved out, a third appeared and followed a parallel, but slightly closer track. As THAT moved out, a fourth appeared and passed even closer. The last three may have been redder than the first. The fourth may have exhibited very slight, rapid variations in brightness. No sound audible above background noise—fireworks in town (ca. 1 mi. SE), traffic, and so on.

    "text": "After New Years Eve firework display, I saw up to 5-6 Amber pulsating UAP’s hovering and then moving East to west, before vanishing. \n \nLocation: \nSeen from Tualatin, OR \nApprox 23-26 miles south of PDX Airport \n \nTimeframe & Details \nMidnight - big fireworks going on from some house below me. Then at \nvideo #1 12:07 (i'm facing straight to the East and the fireworks were fairly low in the sky - just above the houses below me). \nDecided to go out and take a video of what my friend was missing out on, to show her in am). Went out and ended up only seeing and filming the very last firework. Clicked the phone off, and then I saw a strange large amber glow up and over a little to the right..opened the phone and snapped a pic. (I wanted to video but opened in camera mode and snapped a pic instead. \n12:08 - picture. What I saw was a lot bigger visually than what the camera shows. hurried and went to video, because it looked so different from anything I've seen in the sky. It seemed to be hovering - like a helicopter would, in my mind, like it was watching the fireworks. for some reason, i waved haha. then noticed it was now moving... that's when my nerves started freaking out. \n12:08 - 1st video of object- while filming, i could tell it was slowly moving in my direction, not at me, but straight from East to west. I went to move to get a better angle to video, and my sandal was frozen to the ground, so after pulling a few times, I moved and started filming again. \n12:09 - Continuing the filming of the 1st object I saw. (seemingly to slowly move West/SW and possibly climbing.) \n \nNotes: \n1. While watching the video back, I noticed that there was a lower object shown at the end of the video, but didn't notice it then, because when I looked back to my left, to walk back to my back door, i saw 2 more coming from same direction as first, and they were also moving very slowly. \n2. From the time I started videoing the first one, in my mind, I kept repeating, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared. I was so filled with fear. After waving and noticing the first one slowly moving somewhat in my direction, I couldn't get the image of it coming over my house and then all the other scary thoughts that go with that were running through my head.. \nIf any of them would've come towards my house, I wouldn't have been able to continue to video. I felt that scared! \n3. Because it was so cold and my nerves were on high edge, I was shaking a lot and videos were not steady. *the object's movements were very slow and steady. \n4. There was what seemed like a bright, big, close star or possible satellite?? from viewing that, it can help see the movement of the objects as it/they pass in front of it. \n5. It was clear - with some possible haze - I couldn't tell for sure. but I could see the constellation Orion (so small compared to \"bright star' low in the south sky, which was up and further over to the west from where all the objects seemed to just blink out. At first, I thought they faded into a possible haze I couldn’t see, but really it was as if they blinked in and out a few times then just vanished. \n6. Weather - Cold/freezing, but no precipitation or wind that i noticed. \n7. I can send a video of typical air traffic and a map of where I am, in comparison to PDX airport. Pattern of most air traffic I see, follows I5 direction, going South to North, to the airport or north to south, away. \n12:10-Video of next 2 objects and notice a third separate one in the frame. I try to turn my phone sideways - you can still track them from the steady bright white light. \n12:11 Continued filming of those 3 objects, but starting with my phone sideways. talking to myself - saying that it was as if they were watching the fireworks. the movements of two objects traveling together, seemed so weird to me. Like they are separate, and doing a little dance together. \n12:12 - moving to try and capture them as they moved away West, then they just seemed to flicker out.) \n12:12 - tried to focus on bright white spot, to see if I could find them again. nope \n12:13 - Then Saw one more coming from my left (East). I think I whispered something like \"Don't scare me, Oh my God, there's another one\", and I was so scared, i stopped filming sky, and started walking to my back door to go inside. Then lifted my phone to continue to film the object, while standing next to my door. \n \n*The objects did not make any sound that I could hear. At all. (And I can often hear flight traffic from planes and helicopters). \n \nWent inside, and my heart was pounding out of my chest. seemed like my fear senses were on overdrive... I was so scared that I ran up to where my friend was staying and said in a loud voice, Sheryl, Sheryl, I think I just saw ufo's - Sheryl.... She didn't respond, so I didn't want wake her. \nso I called my friend in MT (12:28), who I was talking with a little after 11- Sharing the videos and writing \"Dude, it was closer than the picture shows, like my heart is still racing. I was so scared to be out there, like I even backed up close to the door, missing some of it, I was literally that scared.\" \n \nCould not go to sleep - so worried that I'd have little visitors in my room.. \nstarted texting with my sister in Mt, around 3 who happened to just respond to my earlier happy new years text. I was so grateful to be texting with her, because I was still so scared and couldn't fall asleep. I ended up only sleeping maybe 1/2 after her text, when i then woke and ended up not being able to fall back asleep. \nDetails I shared with her. \n*They were a lot closer than what my camera could catch. \n*So scared my heart didn't stop beating hard for at least 1/2 hour. \n*Seemed like they were just pulsating. no flicking on and off light patterns, like typical aircrafts at night. \n*No other color (white,red,green, etc) other than Amber-like glow - kind of pulsating. I'd say I'd compare it to staring at a part of a candle flame. \n*\"Moving going from east to west and I swear they seemed to be hovering around my area, before slowly moving off. I was so scared. and then they just disappeared one after the other. After moving towards West, They just kind of flickered out of sight. \n*Hard to tell, but it definitely seemed like some sort of vehicle - bigger than a helicopter. appeared to be between a circle and triangle, maybe Triangle with more rounded corners . possibly the amber light was deeper in color in the area under the edges. The whole bottom was this candle amber like and didn't seem like it stayed solid - color in movement like a candle would or pulsating somehow. \n*Seemed like they were watching the fireworks. Moved a lot steadier than what my camera captured. they kind of sometimes flicked in and out. It was so scary and amazing at the same time. The first couple seemed to literally be hovering for a while, before slowly traveling to the west. \n*My cat was so freaked out that I found her hiding under my bed. could be because of the fireworks, but when i finally got her out from under there, she stayed on my chest for at least an hour. (usually just sleeps on the end of my bed), and when she got up, she still laid close by my side. She was acting off all night and very skittish. I did not sleep - so scared. \n \nI wish my phone could’ve captured what my eyes saw. \n \n1/1 11:20am Text with My uncle who is retired, but flew fighter jets, then flew for other sec of govt, then i think around 30 yrs commercial... What I wrote to him, and then his response. \n\"I saw them hovering then moving slowly to the right, They were so much closer and larger than what seems in this video. I noticed them after watching a firework in the sky for New Year Eve. I look a little to the right and bam saw the hovering and then moving slowly to the west. \nHe asked if the white dot was a plane - \nNo, I think it was a low bright star (but looked bigger and closer than other stars and Orion that i could see in the sky. maybe it was close bright satalight? \nWhite dot - no movement, has slight sparkle)- you can use it to see how slow they're moving and how they move past it. Honestly as they moved to the west and maybe a little higher, they just vanished. \nFirst I saw one, then 2 with a sep one... then another came from the left as they disappeared in the west sky, more came... I think I saw 5-6. No red white or green lights, no flashing, just this pulsating glow. For as close as they were, no sound. in one of the videos you can see that i was so scared my phone went to my feet walking towards my back door, because I was going to run into the house, but then I shot the phone back into the sky to capture the last UAP. \nFrom the videos it sent him, he said that he saw no landing lights, so flashing on off patterns, no white or red lights. I then sent him video of airplanes at night - flying their typical north south pattern to pdx. \nSaid it's nothing that he can recognize or explain, and recommended that I file a report.",

    "text": "Blinking but sporadic \n \nI was standing outside last night around 630 PM, but it has been many nights now on and off. I see these light on occasion. I notice all of the Police drones and airplanes because I'm right next door to a private airport. The airport has a helicopter for a hospital or for the military right there as well. I'm right next door to state Police building and a National Gaurd base. Also, down the street, is where the Sheriff's park their vehicles and a jail is located down there as well. I've been noticing these strange blinking lights in the sky. They appear to be almost metaphysical the way they blink. I've noticed them on other videos on YouTube in suspect sky videos. It's a moving craft but that blinks like an airplane, but it's the way it blinks that's impossible. It's completely impossible for humans. I've noticed them following me from McClean Virginia to Leesburg. I've had wierd events happen to me now with serious winds and strange darkness fall upon me at random times. I have proof of finding ancient pieces of the comet that killed the dinosaurs and perfectly preserved dinosaur bones and possible alien artifacts. I was driven off the road by total strangers at 70 mph into a ditch only two weeks ago. All my money was stolen out of my account at the same time. Now I'm surround by Police and Military who are sending up there own craft to confuse me. Theirs a big difference in the UFOs and the man-made craft. The Police and National Gaurd are trying to mimic the Alien craft to confuse me. This is not a hoax. I have the rocks and dinosaur bones to prove I'm telling the truth. My car is totaled. Some fanatic tried to murder me for no reason. I think it might have to do with the blinking lights. The UFOs have shot laser shows close to me in McClean. Impossible for humans to do. Spinning laser lights. They are up there right now. Look for impossible blinking. Those are UFOs. The Police and military are trying to cover it up by flying craft with blinking lights near the UFOs. That's because they know those are alien lights. Look up especially on clear nights. You will probably see them. You will see the Police trying to cover it up. They are here and I think they are dangerous.",

The route is used by airplanes going to land at LaGuardia Airport but you always hear the airplanes and see the flashing lights. There some low hanging clouds and I also noticed that there was not the straight beam of light you see at night when airplanes have their lights on.

While outside watching the last of the fireworks I saw a green and red light flashing slowly in the sky. I obviously assumed it was a plane for a moment however it then started to move in a totally random fashion... Realising it was a UFO or maybe 2 I ran in and grabbed my iphone 11 pro, just before I managed to start filming the initial lights blinked out, then this light reappeared for just over 30 seconds.. unfortunately i didnt have time to change settings on my phone (ie to 4k 30fps) so its only in HD 1080p 25fps and very noisy footage but it was amazing to see... I stayed outside until 7am hoping it would return but it didnt... it almost seems to blink out as a big firework goes off... The initial lights, red and green were circling each other darting around the area of sky in a rapid motion. there was no noise (when the fireworks stopped for a minute) heres the link to the footage i did manage to catch, please feel free to contact me for any more details. I can also send you the file from my phone although its compressed with h.264 codec so isnt much better resolution wise. I work as a designer and musician so i work alot in photoshop and after effects etc so im going to have a play with the camera footage (increase a still image resolution in photoshop etc... not sure what i will be able to do in after effects though as im just a motion designer, see work on glenwilsoncreative.com as im an art director and my technical skills are not amazing to see what i mean). its more interesting to watch frame by frame as it seems to move in an S shape in the sky. \n \nyoutube link \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k_F4A2swvk",

    "text": "Heard unusual noise unlike planes I'm used to. Saw craft in distance looking like an ALCM with a brown haze around it. \n \nI was sitting on my front porch. Weather was clear and warm for January. Was mid-afternoon. Can't remember the exact day. I heard a sound somewhat like a small private prop. plane, but different. I live just a mile from Roanoke-Blacksburg regional airport. I like aircraft, so I was interested to see what this odd-sounding plane was. I looked around, but didn't see anything at first. Then, I looked up and toward the south, and up a few thousand feet. I saw a craft that looked, as best I can describe, like an air launched cruise missile. A long, but not cylindrical fuselage with vertical and horizontal stabs at the rear. No wings. Maybe a bit larger than a private plane. It had a brown haze around it. The haze and no wings is what made me want to report this incident. Aircraft flying by before this at altitude were very clear with no haze. It was flying level in a south-south easterly direction. It's speed was unremarkable at the moment I saw it. My binoculars were just inside my front door, about eight feet from where I was sitting. I reached in and grabbed them to get a better look at the craft, but it had disappeared in those few seconds I had my back turned. I can't swear that the noise I heard was this craft, since I'm so close to the airport, but it did get me looking all around. I have looked at photos of our military drones, but none look like what I saw. The ALCM is the closest thing to what it looked like.",

My daughter got a telescope for Christmas and we finally have been able to zoom in on the lights. They appear in the shape of a donut with the center and four wings almost like cardinal points on a compass, lightless. However between these points are hundreds of small lights. The lights vary in color but are mostly white. The objects tend to hang out in the same area for hours when I notice them. Over the time period they are around, they flicker and slowly move up in down and back and forth within a zone in the sky. Eventually, they dim out and disappear. I am hoping to get video or pictures to add to this site soon. Tonight we saw four, we were able to get 3 in the telescope lens and they appear equidistant apart or close to it.

    "text": "possible abductions when I was a kid living in Ct. in the middle of the night i would be forcibly floated out of house by short people \n \ni have a few memories of very lucid dreams or something which took place when I was quite young(between the ages of 6-10?) which at the time seemed significant even to me at that age. I remember one night being floated against my will down the stairs of our house. I was terrified , and my feet were about a foot off the ground .there was a short figure (even seemed shorte than me )which I took to be a which and it was beside me the whole time. I tried to grab the wall and the bannister but could not get a firm hold. My next memmory, can't say wether or not it was the same night, occured in my driveway. this one happened repeatedly. I would find myselfe being floated down my driveway towards the road by little grey men . that they conformed so accurately to the modern stereo-type is the reason that I am reporting these events.  thes e guys seemed very real to me. after the first time I seemed to recognise them and them me . like with the witch, my feet were about a foot,maybe two feet off the ground and I would keep trying to find the ground so i could run, with my legs moving in a cycling motion below me ,but i never found it. This hpenned about three or for times and at least one of the times one of my little sisters was there with me. At the time I thought these were morethan dreams and wondered if maybe they were real but in another dimension or something that shared the smame space that I normally lived in but was normally not accesible. I also remember finding myselfe in my next door nighboors back yard in the middle of the night and having to climb up the hill back to my house. I moved to Scotland when i was therteen and didn't have anymore of these dreams. But I did have another strange dream when I moved back to connecticut for university I was staying at a freinds house in New Canaan durring the summer when I had this dream where I was on my back on like a hospital bed , being steered through a huge well lit place by two people. there were many other people , in groups but I didn't take much mote of them.when i was left olone on the bed I tried to run but my feet had some kind of glass sandles or something crudely stuck to the soles. as I ran back the way they had brouht me these sandles slid arround on the mettalic floor.  I ended up in some kind of smaller darker room with some people who were doing a project and were very calm and made me feel more relaxed. this could have just been a dream,I really dont know ,but I mention it just in case anyone else has had a similar one I am 27 years of age and fairly well educated and work as a deck -hand in Miami by the way- about a month ago I saw a green/blue fireball looking north west from my balcony .It was bigger and slower than a shooting star and move more horizontal than virtically. it dissapeared after lees than two seconds. it was almost the sise if the moon.",

We were going to be late for curfew so we were in a hurry. there were no cars coming in either direction. We were driving along and something caught my peripheral vision to the north. We saw about 5 or 6 bright lights coming up from the ground behind the tree line they were so bright they looked like spotlights shining straight up into the air. I was freaking out telling her to stop so we could see what that was so we slowed down considerebly then these lights started to turn in a complete circle all at the same time. We were both going Oh my God what the hell is that?!!! Then the lights just started crisscrossing over one another very fast. I was still begging her to stop so we could watch them but she was afraid of getting in trouble for being late for curfew already so we just drove off. I believe this was a ufo on the ground there are no buildings or houses around where this happened only fields and trees a fairly rural area. This is one of the strangest things I have ever seen. \n \nI don't remember the exact date I only remember it was late spring or early summer in 1989 My friend Kristie VanBrunt and myself were driving westbound on highway 51 to her house we were going to be late for curfew and she didnt want to get in trouble. We were just driving along talking and all of a sudden out of the corner of my right eye I see these incredibly bright white lights shining straight up into the sky there were about 5 or 6 of them and they were arranged in a circle the lights were behind the tree line coming up from the ground. I was like WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!! and told my friend to stop the truck so we could see she wouldn't stop partly out of fear of her parents and the fact she did not know what we were seeing but we did slow down to about 10 miles per hour there were no cars in either direction as far as we could see which was unusual.

    "text": "SUMMARY:  120-140 ft, X 35-40 ft, X 30 ft, triangler craft, metalic colored, 4 lights directly down the center with 2 strobes and 3 very large lights on the back \n \nOn or between Dec 27th 1994 and Jan 5, 1996 at 2100 hours, I went out to get my dog in from the back yard of my home, (6350 East Hayne).  He was in a playful mood and I began to throw small stones which he would chase.  As I was walking over to pick up a few small stones in the corner of walled in yard, I happen to grance up into the very clear, cloudless sky and noticed a darken object very low to the ground.  At first I could not determine if the craft was moving.  At this point it was quite some distance away, approx 1 to 1 1/2 miles.  I continued to watch the craft and it began to get larger.  I knew the craft was obviously coming in my direction.  I kept wondering why the aircraft had not turned on its landing lights be cause the U.S. Air Force Base (Davis-Monthan AFB) was only a few miles south of my home.  The base is almost directly south of my home the the Tucson International Airport is just on the other side (slightly southwest).  I immediately called the craft to!my daughters attention who had just come out to tell me one of my favorate programs had just come on.  We both stood there watching as the craft got closer.  When it was approximately 3/4 mile from us,  it's true shape became visible.  It was a triangle shaped craft, moving very slowly at approximately five to eight miles per hour.  It was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground.  It had no lights on the front of the craft at all.  I told my daughter that it was going to pass almost directly over us.  When it got to only a few hundred feet away, we began to see lights on the bottom of it.  There were four lights that were in a straight line down the middle of it that ran the full lenght.  The lights were spaced about 20 feet apart.  As it passed slightly infront and above us, we could see very clearly that the craft was metalic in color and did not have a smooth surface but appeared to have a plated surface.  I could see what appeared to be lines of rivits that connecte!d them togather.  The craft did not make a single sound, and after spending 18 years on active duty in the Air Force, I knew it was not something that was man made.  It I were going to guess at its weight based on its size as mentioned above---I would say approxmiately 80 to 110 tons.  As I passed by my daughter was the first to notice two stobes on the rear corners that were blinking very fast (much faster than normal aircraft), both were white lights and could only be seen from behind.  Even when the craft was at its closest point from us, could not be seen until the rear of the craft began to become visable.  It was at this pont that I could even more clearly see the previously mentioned plating affect.  I was able to at this point based on the visible edges of the triangle in my own mind determine the thickness of the craft .  The back of the craft had three very large lights , two approximately 10 feet in diamenter and the third much larger light between them.  It was abo!ut 15 feet in diamenter.  It may sound strange but the lights were not giving off a really bright light but definately light that appeared to be defused.  The lights on the bottom of the craft appeared defused as well.  The craft was close enough that a man with a good strong throwing arm could have easily hit it.  I know that this story sounds like something out of a science fiction book, but I swear it's the truth.  I will be more than willing to take any lie-detector test you want.  Feel free to contact me concerning this sighting.  I almost forgot--the following day after the close encounter, while in the restroom of my home preparing to shower or something i remember finding a blister about the size of a dime just above my left ankle.  There was no pain, and I only noticed it as I was taking of my sock.  I pressed slightly on it and rolled my index finger around.  It poped and I expected to feel pain but there was none.  I pealed away the lose skin and noticed that the ti!ssue that should have appeared red or pink was brown.  Normally, blisters don;t leave scars in a perfect circle--this one did.  The only reason I have taken this time to tell you about what we seen, is that I can't stop thinking about it.  I hope if have really reached someone who will take the time necessary to confirm my sighting anyway they have to.  Now I know for sure--They do exist and I don't care who says they don't.  That includes our goverment.",

    "text": "Fast ball of light. \n \nWhile going on a night walk with my friend I noticed something from the corner of my eye, as I turned to look at it I noticed it was hovering next to one of the apartment buildings in my neighborhood. It was hovering next to the second floor window, on the side of the building, and as I looked at it directly it immediately moved to the right, now at what is essentially the 3 floor level but only further away. Then it moved again back to the left and was now hovering near the gutter on the roof of the building before making a curve like motion back behind the rooftop and out of sight, maneuvering in a matter of 3-4 seconds before disappearing entirely. Each time the object moved with such speed it would appear as a blur when moving. It zigged and zagged at incredible speeds, it would move, come to a full stop suddenly. Now when I say suddenly I mean unlike anything I've seem before. My friend who comes from Haiti said that he has indeed seen these objects bef! ore, and it was his belief that it was a spirit or something supernatural. I come from ohio, born and raised in the USA and I don't believe it was a spirit or ghost, simply because of how it maneuvered and stopped. The object was blue, spherical in shape and about 2-3 feet in diameter. The 'ball' was very bright like a small star, however I noticed that not the building next to it, or the tree, or the grass below was illuminated what so ever by this object despite it being very bright when looked at directly.",

Size would be about one hundered + or - a small amount.  Completely blackened and traveling at about 35 miles per hour, no lights and no reflection other than off the upper edge of the fuselage. \n \nI was anchored in tarpon basin which is just off the howard johnston restaurant and adjacet to the tower which placed the tower north by east of out boat.  This was in jan 1996 just prior to crossing to the Bahamas.  I got up to check out the anchor and went on deck as it was a clear warm night,looking up I noticed a line of white being reflected in a diagaonal formation to it`s line of travel looking and traveling somewhat like a flight of birds. A split second later I realized that it was a hard edge reflecting light back towards me ,but not down.  We sailors always have binocullars available so I was able to get a better view immediately.  Being 50mm lens and having good light gathering ability I was able to see the bottom somewhat,; it appeard featurless. At this point I called Connie on deck and gave her the binocs and she was able to see it also. At this time it was impossible to see with the naked eye.  I again watched it go slowely to the northwest  until it completely  blended into the night sky. It was easy to judge the hight and size due to it`s close proximity to the tower.  My background as a private pilot and having built and flown my  own planes and ultrlights allowed me to judge the speed.  As low as it was we both were able to trade off the glasses and abserve the progress.

It was behind a stand of trees that had been planted for wind block. \n \nWe left our friends house off 188th/116th in Renton at 1:00 Am.  I Checked the time before we left.  As we were traveling along 148th (Lake Youngs Road) southwards  we had just gone past 224th,   It was a cold clear night, moonless, I was leaning my head against the door glass watching the stars when I saw the object.  At first I thought it was a reflection on the glass because the image was faint.  I had my husband turn off the interrior lights and it was still there.  I couldn't hear anything so I had him turn off the radio. I rolled down the window.   It wasn't making any sound at all.  It was staying with us as we drove along.  My husband never saw it because of it's angle to the roof of the car.  I wouldn't have seen it myself if I hadn't been leaning against the window looking straight up.  When we came the stop sign where 148th crosses 240th street I watched the object go on over the hill.  In 1974 there were no houses up there.  I heaved a sigh of reliefe because this really spooked me.  Then as we were coming up on the stop sign at 256th a light caught my attention.  It was the object again.  This time coming at us head on about 30 feef off the ground.  We were stopped at the stop sign at this point and I paniced because at the nose of the object was what appeared a wide wind screen, with phosphorus green light emitting with the shape of a  humanoid in the middle.  I screamed at my husband to get us out of there.  He took off with tires screaming,  I lost my memory of the trip home from this point.  The next thing I remember is coming up on the stop sign at highway 18 on Wax Road.  I am completely calm, not worried or anxious.  We arrived home about 5 minutes later.  I took our baby son into his room and put him to bed and then took myself to our room.  The clock on the side of the bed said 3:18 A.M.  This trip we took from our friends home would take 20 minutes any day of the week, day or night.  We had lost 2 hours.  But I managed to convince myself that I must have read the clock wrong before! we left Renton.  I didn't know anything about UFO's or their characteristics at the time and it was easy to write off as just a strange incident in our lives.  After I filed my previous report (9/6/97 incident) I was just browsing your sight.  I read the report of the UFO Flap of 73, the Coyne Hellicopter Incident on 10/18 73 and  just freaked when I read the discription of the object.  It sounds so much like the object I saw on that cold January night.  I asked in my last report for someone to call me.  Now I really need to talk to someone.",

    "text": "Summary : On sequential nights during the month of January, 1988, I witnessed from 2-4 bright amber lights hovering or slowly moving in the western sky over Memphis. On one night, these lights appeared to be performing some sort of synchronized movements, moving in large circles at antipodes from each other, and reversing direction. \n \nI just finished watching the special on the Discovery channel about the lights seen over Phoenix during March of '97. I was impressed by the videos of the supposed 'flares', and was reminded of a similar occurance many years ago. Over the course of the month of January 1988, only on weekend nights as these were the only nights I was out, I witnessed in the western sky over Memphis, sometimes 2, and sometimes 4, bright amber lights similar in appearance, color, and 'texture' to flames seen from a great distance. Each night after 0100, while driving south down Old Germantown Road, I saw these lights above the western horizon, in the direction of Memphis International Airport. Sometimes the lights merely hovered, or moved very slowly, almost too slow to notice movement, but on one occasion, my curiosity having been excited by previous sightings, I noticed two objects moving in a large circle, as though orbiting a central point- the circle being approxiamtely 3x the size of a fu! ll moon. The objects maintained a 180 degree opposition to each other as they circled, and once a circle was completed, they reversed direction to complete another circle, before reversing direction again. On this particular night (I cannot remember the exact date), I stopped the car to watch them, and sat parked for about 15 minutes before I got bored, having watched them perform 3 complete circles, so i continued on my way, sure that I would see them again on some other night. And I did, but never again were they so active as on that night. Since then I have seen similar phenomena which proved to be landing lights of comercial aircraft approaching over a great distance on a clear night: the same color and quality of light, the same apparent slow movement, but I have never before or since witnessed such a 'ballet' in the sky. It seems remarkable and highly unlikely that any comercial or military aircraft could move with such precision being separated over so large an area as ! was suggested by the apparent distance from my vantage point, and even more unlikley that such aircraft could stop and reverse direction without slowing.  I have never before reported this because it seemed to me too weak a sighting to be of much consequence; I was never able to identify the objects as anything more than 'lights in the sky.' But after seeing the Phoenix videotapes, I was amazed by the similarity to what I saw over those nights so long ago. These were not my only encounters during the same 12-month period, but it has been so long now, I don't that my information can be of much value. I am, however, interested in relating what I have seen, both in the sky and elsewhere, to interested scientific and documentary authorities.  If needed, i can supply photocopies of maps showing my position and the direction of the sightings.",

    "text": "Large red orange light was seen traveling slowly over Zurich on New Year's Eve under a cloudy sky. \n \nA red/orange light which appeared to shift between red and orange and which appeared much larger than an airplane light and much larger than Venus at it's brightest was seen moving slowly across the night sky of Zurich, Switzerland on New Year's Eve.  The sky was completely overcast so it was clear the the object was not a star or anything in space. We were watching some fireworks in the distance so many of our eyes were turned skyward.  I don't have any directions to give you at all but the light in the sky was there for about 10 minutes before it registered with me.  I just thought that it was a super bright star but then after the fireworks stopped it hit me that the sky was completely clouded over and at that time I called it to the attention of my five friends.  Nobody had any idea of what it could be and after about 10 more minutes the object started to slowly move over the city.  Two of us had cameras but my friend with the digital camera had (wouldn't you believe it, just at this moment, just like in the movies!) technical problems and he was not able to get a shot. I was able to get off a few shots.  I made sure that I got a building in the picture to aid in determining the distance and with luck a low flying airplane flew near the object so I was able to get the object, an airplane, and a building in one shot.  The camera was just a little point and shoot model so the negatives are extremely underexposed.  I don't know how much use they would be. It really just looks like a light with a dark background. The object moved out of my view after about twenty minutes.  We heard no sounds coming from the object. I was wondering if anybody else reported this.  It must have been seen by a lot of people because it was up there for so long and it was moving so slow. I would love to hear something from you. I can get images to you if you would like them.

Out of my bedroom window I saw an orange fireball flying by, so I went into the kitchen to look out the window and told my sister to come and see the meteor coming down.  When I opened the curtains my sister and I saw a black diamond-shaped craft hovering over the porch.  It was about ten feet wide and had large green lights on the points of the diamond.  A very low rumbling sound shook the house, the window glass was rattling and the sound seemed to be going through my chest.  We watched it for a few minutes, then the thing slid off the porch roof horizontally, then lifted up and flew away.  It was blacker than the sky, and it seemed to be flying fast and slow at the same time.  Then 4 jets from the Westover Air Force Base chased it but were far too slow to catch up with it. My sister and I started to walk out of the kitchen, but I don't remember going to bed.

My hair was spread out on the pillow and my arms were crossed mummy-style when I woke up.  My door was locked, so my parents had not tucked me in-- and I was too old for that anyway, since I was 14 at the time.

I happened to look up and noticed what I can only describe as a \"blob\" roughly circular in shape moving from south to north. If asked to provide a better description I guess you could almost describe the object as amoeba-like in its shape. I almost didnt see it because it was completely unlit, I could only see it do to the ground lighting from the power plant and other chemical plants in the area. (This area has a heavy concetration of chemical plants.)It was hard to determine the color but appeared to be slightly off-white or very dull gary in color. It was not moving particularly fast, maybe about the speed of a small propeller plane, and flew in a straight line, not erratic at all.It also made no sound that I could detect although there was a quite a bit of noise from the power plant that may have obscured the noise, if any, that may have come from the object.I had never before heard of any reported UFO's having the same strange shape that I saw. I told the shift supervisor about what I saw but he didnt seem to concerned. I have not reported this to any other agency though I may try to conatc the local FAA in Houston to see if anything strange was reported about that same date, time and vicinty.

She heard nothing, no sound whatever.  \n \nShe then drove on to the next intersection, turned her car around, hoping to see whether the object had left.  \nIt was then that she and her daughter witnessed a second object near the first, then a third and a fourth on the opposite side of the highway from the first, and very low to the ground.  Even though there was low ground fog, they could see the objects distinctly.   \n \nThey saw a fifth object shortly afterward, at which point they decided to drive into town.  As they drove toward Clatonia, they saw another object come out of the fog.  \n \nShe called Columbus, NE, airport, where she learned that they had had no aircraft in the area at that time.  They also told her that they had a radar \"shadow\" in the area where her sighting had taken place",

For 1/4 of a mile I had a totally unobstructed view of this object until the road became divided by a tree line, though I could still see the object through the tree limbs. The tree line ended about 200 yards from where Murray Road ends into franklin Road, and I had another unobstructed view of the object. The object appeared to be keeping pace with the speed of my car. The object then faded out and I could see it no more. After turning left onto Franklin Road I looked left, then right and saw the object again. It appeared to be flying once again at the exact same distance and altitude. Again I had a totally unobstructed view of this object as it now flew over a farm field. Again the object faded from my view, then about 3 seconds later reappeared. I watched this object for another 10 to 15 seconds, until this object faded from view for the last time.

    "text": "Two bright objects perpendicular to one another and appeared to be heading on a fast collision course, when one passed over the other, the lower continued east, then just disappeared, seconds later, the other continuing north, disappeared also. \n \nThe viewing location was in my pasture about 32 miles west of Tulsa, Okla and 5 miles south, in the area 6 miles west and 2 1/2 miles south of Mannford, Okla near 2 east and 2 south of Silver City, Okla (but it's probably not on a map). About 1 1/2 hours after sunset my wife and I were unloading hay out in an open pasture for the cattle. The evening was cool, clear, and silent, with no wind or clouds,and I don't believe there was any moon yet. I saw the Orion constellation in the east and looked higher and saw the constellation above Orion that looks like a little letter \"Y\". Directly over my head I noticed a bright roundish object moving at a high rate of speed from due west to due east. It was brighter than any star in the sky and appeared to be a single glob of white light. Thinking it to be a meteorite I told my wife to look straight up. She did and listening, there was no sound, and no trail behind it or anything. I then noticed motion in the southern sky and saw an identical bright white object speeding due north. Both objects were now in clear view and I judged by their heading, that they would barely miss crashing into one another. They kept coming, never slowed, and they didn't burn out or weaken in intensity of their light. They both seemed fairly large considering the distance, or altitude they seemed to be at, larger than a big jetliner I would say, yet there was no noise, no vapor trail, no winding jet turbo-drone type sound, and going way too fast, yet it was perfectly quiet. The object coming from the south passed just over the top of the object coming from the west and both continued straight ahead on their same respective courses. As I watched the first object continue due east, it unexpectedly disappeared at about a 60 degree angle up from the east horizon as measured along the path of my line of vision. It went from full bright white, to dim blue white, to gone in half a second. No sparks, no tail, no trail, nothing. I looked back north to the other object and it continued bright and was getting further away, racing along at the same high speed. Low on the horizon to the east I could see the soft glow of the city lights from Tulsa, hidden from my view by hills, yet illuminating the humidity and/or dust and pollution hanging in the air. I noticed an airplane low to the east northeast about where the Tulsa Int'l Airport is located. The plane looked like it was heading west, and probably had just taken off. The plane had a solid white light on the front and a red blinking light to the side, as is common. I strained to hear the plane, but it was still too far away, as it is at least 45 miles to where the airport is located. I realized when looking back to the bright white object that the object was traveling at least twice or more than the speed of the airplane, and was much brighter. As I watched the object speed due north, now in the distance, it suddenly dimmed to off white for a fraction of a second, then just vanished from sight. Maybe both objects individually turned off their light at different times, but there was never so much as a blink of any colored light, or any warning light, only a bright white, a single, same intensity, solid white light. I'm thinking that maybe the altitude where they were passing through was high enough that surface reflection was occuring from the sun, which had already set in the west, an hour and a half earlier. As we watched the first object speed east it could have gone into the Earth's shadow, making it invisible to us. Same with the second object a few seconds later, as it was higher because it passed over the first object at their point of crossing, so it may have reflected sunlight for a little bit longer time until it got too far to the north in the Earth's shadow and just seemed to disappear. We looked back to the airplane, and it continued it's slow progress forward. We are both used to seeing satellites circling the Earth, falling stars, meteorites, meteor showers, comet tails, etc. I've never seen anything like this, both were clearly bright, fast, and seemed to have purpose in their close pass at each other. We stood a few more minutes and looked around, scanning for more information, more clues, but there was none. I have no idea what the objects were, or what they were doing.",

One of the witnesses reported that the objects had 4 lights each on the bottom of the craft, in a + formation. Object itself was not seen, but from the light formation, we are assuming the craft is triangular or airplane shaped. After 2-3 minutes of just sitting there, each object took off at tremendous speeds into a different direction(ex. object 1 came from the North, shot into the East, object 2 came from the South, shot into the West). The witness I spoke to mentioned that he couldn't remember any sound, but wasn't for sure. I am an independent Ufologist, and this report came to me from a co-worker who saw these objects with their brother. From the description he gave me, I first considered the possibility that these were convential aircraft, maybe refueling or performing some kind of training. However, the objects he described seem to fit the description of an airplane maybe, but after he told me that they became stationary, I'd never heard of any airplane performing such a feet in mid air, at least not 100 + ft. above the ground. I'm not convinced that these craft were extraterrestrial, but they don't have the characteristics of being anything I've ever seen or read about that could be military or experimental.",

On the bottom was a pulsing green light. I was in awe and wanted to go closer. The petrified boyfriend wouldn't allow me to get out of the vehicle (held my arm tight).

This air craft swiftly came from the clouds dropped down to about 40 - 50 feet of the school yard and hovered for about a minute.  We all stood and stared in awe.

He drove the area that this craft could have crashed at and saw nothing unusual. In 1997 my family including my father and sister revisited our old school site.  The school as since burned down.  But my father is a friend of the sheriff that was called that day.  He asked him if he remembered this incident.  He admitted that he didn’t remember that particular incident, but that was because he had been called out on numerous calls involving unidentified flying objects.

    "text": "Large, dark, silent, graceful object with lights seen moving up canyon \n \nWe (friend and myself) were coming down the mountain after finishing up some work on a bed & breakfast project.  We were at a point in the canyon that begins to open up (and eventually turns into flat desert about three or four  miles further ahead of where we say the object.) The night was clear.  There was enough natural light from the stars that you could see the cabins and ranches though not much detail.  The other side of the canyon terrain was visible.  It wasn't \"pitch dark.\"   \n \nAll of a sudden we noticed movement in the canyon just ahead of us.  We could not make out WHAT we saw because the object was dark.  There was an eery silence.  We both saw it and slowed down to view it. It was in the center of the canyon heading in the direction (into the canyon) that we were leaving.  The massive size of the thing was what struck us as odd, not to mention having no idea as to what we were looking at because it was too big to be going into that area.   \n \nWe slowed the Suburban down to watch it.  It was silent, we could see the outline of it due to the way it blocked out everything.  In other words, we could see where it wasn't because the background of the canyon was illuminated enough to outline it.  It was as if this thing absorbed light because there was no reflection from it.   \n \nWe both asked one another \"what is that?\"  It had lights at the front and back.  Just small lights.  It moved in a graceful manner with simialr motions to that of a helicopter (up, down, sideways, forward backward).  There was no sound.   \n \nI remember thinking it reminded me of the Hindenburg photos I have seen though it did not look \"balloon-like\".  This thing seemed solid.  Just the shape reminded me of it though this was a bit more oval instead of \"cigar-shaped\" as I would refer to the Hindenburg.   \n \nWe watched it for a mile or so and then when we looked back again it was gone. There was no way it could have gone into the canyon any further as the canyon narrows.  It was too large.   \n \nWe were probably a quarter of a mile from it when we passed it.  Trying to give an idea of its size is difficult.  Maybe the size of a DC-10 jet (if you drew an oval around the jet that is.)   \n \nI remember being strangely aware of the eerie feeling though not fearful.  We both just looked at each other and agreed \"that was weird.\"   \n \nI have been told by skeptics that \"oh, it was a weather balloon.\"  I disagree though I have no other answer than to explain what I saw.",

Me and my girlfriends Father seen two UFO's over Manitoulin Island.  I was facing SW.  They appear to be bright yellowish lights and they didn't move.  Each had its own shape.  One cicular and the other was shaped like a comet with two tails and a round head.  The sky was clear and the sun was setting.  They looked like they were on the edge of earths atmosphere.  I video taped about 30 to 60 seconds.  Me and a friend kept an eye on the UFO's as we traveled west on the island.  And as we dipped into valleys we couldn't see them (we were not in a line of sight).  We watched them for about 5 more minutes then we lost track of them.  They appeared to change into a circle as we traveled west.  I have them on 8 MM video. I asked a local store owner about UFO's there and he said he sees them all the time but is afraid to tell anyone in fear they might think he is crazy (its a small town).

Approaching Green Ridge I saw what appeared to be a disc of light (such as a planet). It was the color of and amber sodium light. It remained motionless for a minute or two after I first saw it, and then started to move to the right. As I approached the 35 MPH sign in Green Ridge, it moved to the right, and seemed to spiral (like a kite without a tale). It spiraled at least once and I thought twice. At the 35 MPH sign, the road turns to the North East and I looked over my shoulder to the right and saw it plummet to the ground leaving a long tale. The light and the tale remained the same color as when first observed! Thursday night while at work, a person said to someone else that there was a report of a UFO in the newspaper. I had to go ask him where he saw it and he said it was in the break area. I went to find it and someone else said he saw it also in the paper but did not read it. Subsequently I asked a the school in Green Ridge, at the Casey's store and asked the police officer, but no one was familiar with the incident. This is not the first UFO I've ever seen! I saw one in 1967 directly over Udorn AFB Thailand about midnight, some time probably in June.",

These lights appeared to be ascending southward at a steep angle, were about as bright as Venus (which was in the western sky), and appeared about the same \"size\" as Venus. They only appeared for about a second or two and then faded out, one at a time. They were spaced somewhat equidistantly from each other. When one was fading, another was increasing in intensity. I counted five in one short interval of time; however, there appeared to be more similar lights (southward) through the clouds and treetops as we turned and proceeded to go to our home about 1/4 mile south. I called this observation into the Sheriff's Department (Adams County, Wisconsin) and then went back outside to see if we could see anything else. We saw what appeared to be two very fast strobe lights, probably on two jets, coming from the south. These \"lights\" circled the area where the orange lights had appeared and then headed back south. We saw the orange lights at 7:36 p.m. and the strobe lights were last seen at 7:51 p.m. this evening. We have never seen anything similar to this before.

No car present. Immediately looked up and heard a \"whoosh\", or something cutting through the wind, like a hang-glider-only I saw a fairly large (approx. 30 ft long) black cigar shaped aircraft of some sorts. I have experience working around aircraft at night, and this was very different.  It had no sound (engine) after the initial noise. It flew from south to north just above a mature tree in our back yard. It dissappeared in an instant-making no noise at all. It was truely amazing. I wondered what I had just witnessed. Maybe some new Govt aircraft. I called EVV and talked to ATC. No reports of low flying aircraft. Our house lies under the approach pattern for aircraft from the south-however we are 6 miles south of the airport-much too far for an aircraft to be at an altitude of 40-60 feet. There are too many power lines for it too have been a hanged-glider, plus it was dark. That would have been suicide.",

We had the radio tuned to 94 fm: the edge. We were headed into New Plymouth at the time and i knew there was enough coverage in the area to keep the radio waves going. The radio started giving a static buzz at about the time we left inglewood.This continued for about 1 minute and we decided to switch the radio off. As we approached the next corner I saw an orange light over the trees. It soon vanished. As we neared the sighting spot we slowed down to see what it may have been. Nothing unusual could be seen. We retained speed through the next few corners and something orange hovered above us. It appeared to be about 100 feet from the ground and looked to be between 30 and 50 feet long and the same in width (basically circular). There were five of us in the car at the time:Me, my brother, his girlfriend, their friend and a friend of my own. We all could see it. The object seemed to hover soundlessly as we all stepped out of the car. As we looked around we saw three other objects hovering and swaying around in the air. They looked like they were changing colour from metallic glowing orange to metallic deep purple and shades of blue. One more larger object appeared on the horizon and sped towards the other 4. Each seemed to react in a way similiar to an army unit and formed a line and dissapeared almost instantly over towards Mount Taranaki.

    "text": "I have seen this craft for years and would like to know what it is please. \n \nActually, I found this site while searching the internet for photos to try to identify what I have seen. And to be honest, it's the first time that I've actually come to \"grips\" with what I've seen and decided to try to get to the bottom of it. My sightings have been numerous the past six years but this is the first time I have seen them early enough in the evening to get my husband and my son to look also. You may think I'm nuts (I know I did until I had witnesses to it) and I hope that you don't have a text limit to this report because I have quite a lot to tell. Although I'm reporting a sighting of four craft tonight, January 1, 2001, I'd like to begin by telling you about the first time I saw this craft and the events thereafter. It was about 6 years ago and I woke at about 3:15 AM. From where I was sleeping, I could see out the window that faces to the east. I saw what first appeared to be a twinkling star in the distance over the treetops but I noticed that it had colored lights and it was moving incredibly fast. So I closed my eyes and opened them again and tried to focus on it, thinking I was seeing things. It went zipping around the sky, up and down, left and right, like nothing I'd ever seen. So I got out of bed and went to the window and watched it. I kept blinking my eyes, thinking I can't be really seeing this...but I was. And then it zipped off out of sight. A few months later, I was cleaning out a mobile home on our property that had belonged to the original owners (an elderly couple) of our house and they used it for a summer home for years while they lived in California. I found a box of photos and in it was a VERY CLEAR picture from 1967 of a \"flying saucer\" over the same treetops that I had seen this flying object, only it was taken in broad daylight. I showed it to my husband and said it sure looked like a UFO and that I had seen one in the night some months ago. Anyways, I mailed that packet of photos to the owners in California and they have since passed away. I am going to contac! t her so n to see if I can retrieve that one photo. Since that time, I have seen these same lights in the sky on many occasions and always in the same place. I live in Maine and about 30 miles from Brunswick NAS so I've always kind of hoped what I'm seeing is just some kind of military secret and not something extra-terrestrial. Here's the real kicker though. This past summer, I was sitting at the picnic table in the backyard talking with my husband. The day was overcast with cumulus type clouds...not really low in the sky but not terribly high either. I remember they were gray looking and seemed to promise a storm. While we were talking I saw a triangular craft with four very large \"balls\" of light on it appear briefly just below a cloud and then disappear back into it. I said to my husband, \"What the hell was that?\" He didn't see it as he was facing me but recalls me mentioning it to him. That's always bothered me what it was. And while looking around the internet tonight for what the heck it is I've been seeing out there to the east, I happened to come onto a picture of what I saw in the western sky. It was the same triangular craft with the four lights that I've found on a number of sites like the sighting in Belgium in the late 1980s. Well, that's pretty scary! I freaked out and made my husband come look at the photo. I wanted to pass that one up as some kind of military craft too but it was just so huge and now I've seen a photo of it seen by someone else on the other side of the world! Sheesh! But again, I live close to a Naval Air Station and was raised a \"Navy Brat\" and I just suspected it was classified military stuff even though it sure seemed strange at the time. Been around airplanes all my life. Sorry for rambling here but there is just so much to tell that I have kept locked up for the past 6 years. Anyways....I have seen the \"craft\" I saw tonight on many occasions and more in the last year than in the prior 6 years. It stays pretty much stationery and always appears in the same place in the sky no! matter what time of year. Call me silly but I've always thought that if I watched it too closely, it might start watching me. That's kind of the way that it acted the first time I saw it 6 years ago. So, when I've seen it, I just kind of tried to put it out of my mind and pretend it wasn't there. Okay, here comes the part when you will think that I am totally crazy but I need to tell you this so you will understand why I made a real effort to try to see more of this sighting tonight. Last Summer, it was about midnight, and I was up late reading in the livingroom. My husband was in bed and I heard a car drive up, slow down and pull into my driveway. My first thought was \"Who the heck is coming here this time of night?\" We live in the country, we never go anywhere and we rarely have visitors at night, especially late. So...I got up and went to the front door and looked out and it was MY car that had pulled into the driveway and it was still running! Okay, okay, I know you think I'm either nuts or making this up but my husband will tell you that it happened. He woke when he heard the car pull in and thought the same thing I did...who could be coming here? And I called my parents in Florida a few days later and told them of this. They can tell you it happened. This could be related or not related but I have to add it into this report since it is a real mystery that we can't solve. Anyways, right after that, I started seeing this craft in the sky more frequently and tonight it started with the usual one in the usual place. I decided to become brave and try to take a closer look at it. It was quite a ways off..as the crow flies the coast is probably 15 miles from us to the east...and it seems to sit near there...quite a ways in the distance. I first spotted it at 7:00 PM tonight when I took the dog out. It always seems like a twinkling star but I see the colored lights on it. I went in and asked my husband where his binoculars were. He said, \"Why do you want them?\" I said I'm going to look at a UFO that has been bugg! ing me f or years. I wish I had a telescope because that thing sat there for 3 1/2 hours without moving much. It moved three times...all three times that it did move was when an airplane entered the airway between where I am and it was. Each time, the craft blinked red and green lights more frequently (more like a plane's lights will) as the airplane would near the area of space it was in, and it would move horizontally and a bit vertically. When the airplane passed, it stopped and remained stationery until the next plane came along. About 75 minutes after I spotted this first craft, a second one appeared. I watched it approach from the north and take up a position above and to the left of where the original craft sat. About that time, I told my husband there were two of them out there now. He started to take me serious and went out with the binoculars to look and agrees that he's never seen anything like it. About an hour later, two more showed up, each taking a position to the left and north of the previous. But I just checked outside and can only see the original, still there but has moved a bit north. The others are no longer visible. So there you have it. I'm glad I have finally told someone about this...it's been bugging me for years. I would love to receive a rational explanation for all this. I don't know if you respond to these reports, but I would appreciate hearing from you and if you have had similar reports and if you know what this is.",

    "text": "2 more witnesses for that UFO siting that was on tv showing the 'V' Shape formation where 1 disappeared at a time behind the mountain. \n \nHello, I know 2 people who have, in my opinion, more information to that UFO sitting that was on tv.  The one where there were many small ufo's that formed a 'v' shape.  Remember?  Some people thought it was flares.  Then they each slowly disappeared behind the mountain they said. 1 of the people is in my friends band.  They had a party Saturday night, and I was talking to this guy who was friends with the person in the band.  He told me a lot of stuff I can't remember.  What I do remember is this.  He said he went on a trip with S((name deleted)) (The person in my friends band) and they were sitting out in the desert on private property called 'claims'.  He said him and S((name deleted)) were writing songs by a camp fire they lit out in the middle of knowwhere.  I forgot S((name deleted)) friends name, but S((name deleted)) friend looked up and saw many lights just above them.  He told S((name deleted)), \"S((name deleted)), look up and tell me what you see\" and S((name deleted)) was surprised as well.  Cool thing is, S((name deleted)) friend says they have this all on their cassette tape because they were recording song ideas at the time.  I rememeber S((name deleted)) friend saying that there were many lights that were fairly close to them.  He said he could of shot them with a 30 od 6 rifle.  He said each light was zooming from one place to another at too high of a speed for a person to handle.  The 'G' force would be too great for a person he said.  Then he said all the small lights formed a 'V' shape and took off towards, I forget what state or mountains he mentioned, but I bet it was the same place where everyone on tv mentioned they saw it. So to round this whole thing up.  I think these 2 guys have more information to add to that event.  I think they saw the UFO's before everyone else.  I personally believe them from talking with S((name deleted)) friend.  He had know reason to lye about this.  I was the one who said that they should call someone and report this because from the show I watched on this event, they never mentioned individual UFO's that formed the 'V' shape were on their own at first and zoomed around at great speed, then formed the 'V' shape. I told S((name deleted)) and his friend that I would search on the internet for them to see if I could find a place to report UFO's and that's how I found you.  You can call me, and give me a number to contact you after I get S((name deleted)) and his friends phone number.  S((name deleted)) friend says that he would love to tell what happened and even go back to the place he was at and do a film recording for you or whoever does that. I'll leave my information below.  If you call then I'll know you are interested.  I'll then get your number so I can call you back with S((name deleted)) and his friends phone numbers.  I don't have any of their numbers yet.  I will call H((name deleted)), who is the leader of the band S((name deleted)) is in and I will get S((name deleted))s number.  S((name deleted)) will have the phone number to his friend. See ya, and I hope I helped in this event, I'm sure someone would love to hear these guys story. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  No location in Nevada indicate by witness.  PD))",

    "text": "Triangular object traveling south crossed the highway in front of us hovered then turned east and left with no sound. \n \nThe object crossed the highway in front of us coming from the north.  It was approx. 50 feet off the ground and traveling slowly.  We stopped and I got out to see it better.  It was cold and clear out with no moon.  I could see the details by the street lights.  It stopped by the water tower just yards east of it, ocillated, turned toward the east, then sped off. The only sound was as it left, it sounded like a \"tubine\" winding down during shut off.  The object was triangular shaped with the front being the base of the triangle.  There were 3 red lights. One one each corner.  The surface appeared to have a lot of conduit type fixtures on it.  When it left, it passed right over a trailer home of the Mayor of the town.  When I got home, I call the mayor and asked him if he had heard anything approx. 15 min earlier.  He stated that he and his wife didn't hear any thing but they had experienced an earthquake about that time.  He said the walls started shakeing with items falling from shelves.  I contacted Fort Campbell Ky and asked if they had any helocopters in our area.  They would not confirm.  They finally put the flight commander on the phone and the conversation went something like this:  Me: \"Sir, I know that you people have been having problems with the night vision equipment lately but I need to know if you or Scott AFB have any birds in the area over southern Illinois.\"  Commander: \" Sir, I can't give that information out.\"  Me: \"I understand that.  The reason I am asking is I just saw something very unusual.\"  Commander: \"What did you see?\"  Me: \"I saw something cross Hwy 146 in Harding county Illinois at Elizabethtown coming from the north going south.  It was about 50 feet off of the ground and almost hit the water tower.  With the problems that you have been having with Night Vison, they shouldn't be that low in a residential area.\"  Commander: \"Maybe it was a civilian aircraft.\"  Me: \"I don't want you to think I'm crazy but I've never seen an aircraft like that.  Your birds are always flying! over ou r area and I know what helocopters look like but this was different.  I got a good look at it.  It was low.  It stopped not more than a hundred feet from me and my wife and hovered.  It made no sound at all untill it left, then it sounded like a turbine winding down.  It had 3 red lights that did not blink.  I could not see a cockpit or windows.\"  Commander:  \" Which direction was traveling when you last saw it?\"  Me:  East.  I got out of my vehicle and watched it leave at a high rate of speed.\"  I then told him about the mayor's statement to me. The Commander said \"Sir I can't tell you where our birds are due to security, but I can tell you that neither us nor Scott AFB have had any aircraft in your area all day. Do you wish to make an official report?\"  Me: \" No.  I work for the Illinois Department of Corrections.  I may sound crazy but I'm not.  I don't need the problems.",

The freeway travels through the marine corps air station, Mira Mar. Its basiically three miles of darkness at night. As I was looking at the moon low on the horizon, I saw a green light shoot up from the bushes ahead of me to the right. It arced  up to about 100 ft. and leveled off then casually moved horizontally towards the freeway above me. The last view I had of it was leaning over my stearing wheel looking straight up at it. I was so deep in thought as to what the hell it was that I missed my exit four miles down the road. There was no structure surounding the light and it's movement was slightly erratic. Although I was traveling 70mph, I got a good look at it. It was about the size of a soccer ball and green like a traffic light. The air base does touch and goes routinely but in my 23 years of traveling this freeway, Ive never seen a light in the sky behave this way. My windows were up and I didnt hear any sound.

I began to hear a vacuum noise or the sound of air being sucked into a a pipe?. I was listening to this for about 2 or 3 minutes still not moving at all , after a while I noticed something very big had moved over my head at about 1 mph ,Startled I looked up a saw a huge delta or trianke shaped craft, It had no engine sound it looked seemless with a very shiney tinsel type foil making a slight tinkle sound all along the back side. the front seemed to have air collapsing into the front as if taking in air. it was about 30 feet above my head and about 200 feet wide and 100 feet front to rear. it looked like a delta wing. the second i looked up i moved my rifle toward it and it suddenly shot off in about a half second, the woods were quiet again.  I have never seen anything before of after this as far as crafts ,except for the very next night 150 miles back to st.petersburg. My wife and I were both awakened in our bed under our open window at 4 am , we were awokened by a humming sound with a low dull fadeing in and out type of sound, we both looked out and with her as my witness we saw a five foot tall glowing orange ball ,looked like a dim sun' it was sitting rite outside my window! when we talked it began to move off the property and pick up speed til it moved over a very busy intersection and disapered up into the sky \" her exact words were \"what the hell did you bring back with you?!\"   This is were it gets weiard and scary for me about a year ago I was awakened in my bed but I am totally paralized I could only use my eyes ,I looked up and one aliean \"your very typical looking type\" moved rite through my bedroom wall,said nothing to with words ,it used its thoughts to tell me to not be afraid we have something to do here\" the next thing I know 4 or 5 more creeped rite through the other walls from living room and a locked ! door to my room, i was laying on my side and they had inflated my lungs and used an incredable amount of force to blow somthing from my lungs ,they did this several times after they were  satisfied they all left through one wall to the outside. After about 5 minutes or less I was very slowly able to start moving ,I was laying on my side toward the dresser, the dresser was coated a vapor from lungs \"It was 3 feet from my bed\" I got up turned all the lights on and stayed up til work I was 36 at the time and not very comfortable with what I went through , .Although I am aware of a common sleep phenomenon assoiciated with this , I have never had a history of this before or after . For a 24 hour period after this my chest was hurting me as if i had over inflated my lungs.  These are the only three episodes of this type in my history. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Was looking towards Port Angelos and saw a configuration of lights moving west that was approximately in the shape of the Great Bear Star System.  This configuration of lights was moving towards the west at about 1 degree of angle per second and because it was directly over Port Angelos about 1 degree above the city center.   \n \nBecause the whole configuration was moving in a united fashion with the shape of the configuration not changing I don't think I was confusing the lights with those of moving vehicles.

    "text": "Visitation Experience in Korea and other events \n \nI can't recall the year, but it was between 1978-1980.  I was in the U.S. Air Force, stationed at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.  I was living off base inside a housing compound, outside the local town called Silvertown.  There was no light in the one roomed apartment, yet when I looked, I could see clearly.  I remember waking up on the floor.  My wife was on the bed to my left and slightly behind me.  My attention was drawn to the direction of the doorway.  I saw a large dark figure standing in the door.  The figure seemed to be wearing a hooded cloak or cape.  I think it was dark grey or black  in color. \n \nI sat there just staring at it when it seemed to start approaching me.  It didn't appear to be walking.  It seemed to glide across the floor.  I tried to back away from it but couldn't move.  I tried to call for my wife but couldn't make any sound. \n \nAlthough my body refused to respond to my efforts to move, I can remember thinking that if I could make a sound, the fear, and the figure, would go away.  While I can remember it moving toward me, I don't remember it traveling the distance of the room to where I was laying.  That is to say, I only remember it moving a distance of about 3 or 4 feet. I can't recall it ever actually reaching me.  My struggle to move or make some kind of sound seemed to go on for several minutes.  My heart was pounding in my chest and I was desperately trying to call for my wife. \n \nSuddenly, I managed to make a whisper/squeak of a noise.  I tried again and the noise came easier this time. Finally, I was calling my wife's name.  I could move as well, although it was extremely difficult.  I dragged myself to our bed.  I reached up and as I was about to touch my wife, everything was back to normal, if you can call it that.  The stranger was gone. So was the loss of my voice and my inability to move.  However, the room was darker and it was harder to see.  I was still on the floor and my wife was sleeping soundly on the bed.  My heart began to slow down and the pounding reduced itself to a normal beating. \n \nI just sat there. To this day, I call still recall parts of this incident with great clarity.  But I'm not sure if it was a dream.  I don't recall if I had been drinking alcohol that night but it is a very real possibility.  Nor do I understand why I was on the floor instead of the bed with my wife. \n \nI don't know if my wife recalls any of this. I don't even remember if I ever talked to my wife about this, but through the years, I've told this story to others when the topic of strange things comes up. \n \nAt the risk of coming off as a nut case, other strange things have happened to me as well and are as clear or vivid but may mean nothing. \n \nWhile stationed at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom between 1982-83, I recalled leaving the shop one night to go across the street to another building.  As I left the shop, I was in a direct line of sight to the door that I was heading for.  Suddenly, I ran into a heating fuel containment wall some 8 to 10 feet off the original path I was on.  I don't know how I got my original course but it did leave scratches on my shins. \n \nAnother incident at the same base and time frame occurred when I left the shop to catch the bus home.  I left the shop at 10 minutes till 1 AM for what should have been a one minute walk to the bus stop.  However, after I arrived at the stop, I checked my watch and it said the time was 20 minutes after 1AM.  In these two incidents, no alcohol was involved due to the fact that I was just coming off duty. \n \nAnd one morning while in England during the 82-83 time frame, I awoke to find myself inside my wardrode (closet).  However, this one could have been due to drinking, but I thought I'd mention it. \n \nWhile station at Hurlburt Field, Florida between 1991-92, I used to drive a stretch of road every night that was not well traveled or lit at that time of night.  On numerous occasions while driving, I expected to hear a loud popping noise come from the dash of my car.  The expectation was so strong that my eyes where prepared to close the way they do when someone is hammering on something over and over and then they suddenly stop, but your eyes still twitch in anticipation of the next blow. \n \nOne night late 1996 or early 97, while at work with the Gate Rubber Co in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, I experienced what you would call lost time.  I worked with six presses that cure belts for the company.  On this night, I was waiting for press number 4 to open.  I decided to go check something on press number 1 about 15-20 feet away.  I looked at the timer on press 4 and saw that I had 1 minute and 45 seconds before the press was ready to open, so I turned around to go to press 1.  As soon as I turned around and started to take a step, press number 4 opened up.  I stopped and turned back around.  I wondered if maybe I had looked at the wrong timer, but none of the other timers on the unit were set anywhere near a minute and 45.  It was only a minute and 45 seconds and I didn't feel anything else was out of order, but I still recall it with great clarity. \n \nOne day after I had begun working for the University of Arkansas, I experience an incident where I seemed to gain time.  I checked the time that I entered Hwy 412 at the intersection of hwy 530 (old Hwy 71). And began the 20 minute drive to Siloam.  As I entered the City limits, I checked the time again and found that I had made the trip in 10 minutes.  I verified the operation of my watch and the Curise Control that I always used and found them to be in good working order.  I’ve never heard of anyone gaining time, although I have experienced times that I felt time had past quicker than I thought it should have. \n \nI have the standard \"Scoop\" mark on my left leg that I’ve heard and read about.  It's been there as long as I can remember. And in 1999, I noticed that there was a scoop mark on the top of my left hand.  I don’t recall anything out of the ordinary having happened at the time. \n \n*********** Additional back ground information. \n \nWhile I was in the sixth grade, I experienced several incident where there were large scabs in my nostrials.  I remember that my grandmother used to have to use large hair pins to remove them.  This lasted several weeks. \n \nAround 1976/77 while stationed at Beale AFB in California and living in the barracks, I got up one night to go to the bathroom.  As I walked past my papasan chair, I saw someone sitting there and stepped around them to go into the hall.  I closed the door behind me.  When I went back to my room, I had locked myself out. I knocked on the door, but no one answered.  I finally had to go outside and break into the room.  No one was there and the next day, when I asked my friends if any of them had been in the room, they all said no. \n \nAfter reading all this, I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking that I was a nutcase looking for attention.  But I swear that it’s all true to the best of my knowledge.  It’s also convinced me that I need to keep a document of dates, times, and conditions, should anything else occur.  Thanks for taking the time to read through this and as always, if you have any quesitons, please let me know.",

Unfortunately I noticed an error. the report is copied below: \nOccurred : 2/26/1997 07:00 (Entered as : 6:30 - 7:30) \nReported : 1/2/1997 01:03 \nPosted : 3/7/1998 \nLocation : Jamestown, ND \nShape : Changing  \nSUMMARY: The object was around the size of a small car it changed shape and light color and pattern as it moved. it was silent. 15-20mph \n \n1 object that was moving between 15-20mph andfrom 10 to 80 yards off the ground. It was silent and got within maybe ten yards of me.It changed shape and light color and pattern seemingly in relationship to how it moved. Itseemed to move very fluidly. The lights werein the pattern of a sphere, a rectangle, atri-angle. and others....some lights were bright white to tingy yellow, red and electric blue. It eventually went north and left us.  \n \n  \nIf you notice, it says that the event occurred on 2-26-97 and was reported on 1-2-97,  now if that were true it would be almost as fantastic as what I saw!!  :) \nIn actually the event itself occured on 1-1-97.  Please check your records and make the appropriate changes.   Thanks again for all your work. \n \nIf you need verification of my identity just reply my e-mail and I will be happy to provide any info you need. \n \nThank you, \n((signature deleted)) \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected.

I saw in the far northwest a object that looked like a rocket launching. I was taken aback and continued to watch the event as the object came closer I changed my mind on what it was to an airplane on fire. As it came closer to the High School I changend my mind again to a U.S.S.R. Missile, bits and pices were falling off of it and I was stuck not knowing either to run home and warn my mother or run back to warn my girlfriend. I just stood there watching the object come closer two huge beams of light lit up the town looking to me like it was searching for a place to land ( I had changed my mind again to a crashing plane until then.) It came to me that none plane that I knew of had search lights on it as tahey continued to scan the area even reflecting off the silver roof of the hight school. And I didn't know what it was until both light merged on my in the middle of the band field, I was temporay blinded by the bright white blue light. Cars stoped on the street behind me South Rock Island and people got out yelling what is that! I looked up and saw a craft with the back end blown off ti looked like a cookie with a bite taken out off with bits of white flakes falling off of it and disappering before they reach the ground. I saw windows running the lenght of the ship and red emergancy lights in the background and people running from the the back to the front of the craft. One being stopped and saw me looking up at them I want so badly to communcate with them so I waved the being wave back another being ran by stopped and looked at me. It pulled the being I was waveing at away from the window as the craft continued to the southeast, seven alterating disc of multicolor shot off the the south west the disc changed colors were white,red,blue,green,yellow then back to white. I continued to watch the now crewless ship go the southeast and it split ! into thr ee segments and was gone. I rushed home and told my mother what had happend then rushed to a friends house. He was watching T.V. and the announcer came on saying \"If you seen a strang sight in the sky...\" She was cut off later in May on the NBC World News Tom Brokaw said it was a Russian Rocket booster.

It was getting dark (I am not quite sure of the time - somerwhere between 16.00 and 17.00 I suppose), but the sky was very clear. I suddenly saw about seven (7) \"aircrafts\" moving over the city about one kilometer or less away. They moved as if wind and weather had no influence on them.(Not at all like helicopters or other manmade aircrafts). I saw them very distinctly. Their shape was more rounded than cigars. I called my brother and my two kids (10 and 12 years old) and they saw exactly the same as I did. The objects were white or metallic, and they all had lights within and to the sides, and light under theem, shining in all directions. They moved rather fast, in a cortege, so near each other that there is no doubt this was no manmade fenomenon. \n \nBeing an autodidact artist, I am rather used to observing forms and colors, and rendering what I see. I immmediately sketched down what I had seen, and not being satisfied by the fact that I had not sketched exactly what I saw - I must have been nervous! - I asked my daughter of twelve to draw this. She did so very well, and I still have the drawings in my notebook. \n \nMy brother was reading a book when this happened.

This event happened in the middle of the desert.  The nearest person lived over 5 miles away.  The small city of Sierra Blanca was about 10 miles away hidden behind mountains.  My boyfriend and I were staying in this cabin which had no electricy and not running water.  We go there every year for New Year's to get the hell away from people for about 6 days.  We were coming back in the pickup truck from Calsbad Caverns (about 100 miles away). It was dark and the road we were traveling on was an old dirt road back to the cabin.  This place in the middle of NOWHERE. As far as you can see there is desert and mountains.  There is not one other home or light...nothing. \n \nWe topped a ridge and suddenly over to our left there was what seemed to be the outline of a line of \"windows\" in which the lights were extremly bright.  A bright yellow...very intense.  In fact, for a moment I was very disoriented and thought it was a builing and then I remembered that it was impossible for that to be out there.  At the same time my boyfriend said, \"what in the hell is THAT?\"  Our truck went down the road into a gully so the we couldn't see it anymore.  We thought that perhaps it was our cabin on fire;the were so bright and there were two rows one on top of the other.  We raced to our cabin which about a mile down the dirt road thinking it was on fire and the cabin was dark and quiet.  We both agreed we saw the same thing.  My boyfiend refused but I went back to look at the place and saw nothing.  The next day I drove to the place and there were no buildings that could have done that.

My father worked at the Nev. test site for many years and witnessed several unexplainable sightings. I've seen a few fireballs, etc. myself over the test site and surrounding areas. I'd just like to add some legitimacy to the many stories by reporting one of many sighting as told to me by my father in 1969. Standing on a plateau about 20 miles from area 51 he witnessed a craft \"just by chance\" emerge from what must have been an underground tunnel at a very high rate of speed, instantly making a 90 degree turn and shooting off over the horizon. The craft made no sound, nor was there a sonic boom. \"this was 1969, I wonder what they have today\" ? The entire event took less than 5 seconds. My father believed they were testing anti-gravity propelled jets. My response to the man from Las Vegas is, he should get out and watch during the day more. This is when he'll see more activity .

I was just coming home (i  was  NOT drunk) from a new years eve party and happened to see a strange light in the sky.  It was strang only because it was acending in the sky next to another aircraft which was obvisablly a airplane.  For a moment i thought the strange gliding light was also a airplane but it was asending highter and it was brighter then a airplane.  Also this object appeared to be made of light and did not blink.  When stopped acending in the sky it changed its color from a white light to a brighter yellow light.  It was in the western sky which could mean it was flying right over NYC no more then 25 miles away.  It flew in the sky at the same altiude for a few mins and then did  a small, barely noticable zig zag movement and then changed back to its org. white light color.  A min later is disapeared in the very clear night sky.  There was no sound heard, it seemed to be very far away. \n \nI dont know if this is releated but the night before i heard what i thought was a airplane over head but the sound seemed to \"hoover\" longer then an airplane would passing.

    "text": "Large white sphere observed East of Yuma for about 50 minutes.  Disapeared when military craft aproached. \n \nJanuary first, 2003. Driving on rout 8 from West to East, having passed Yuma about 15 to 20 miles behind, we noticed a bright white ovoid object to the North, above the mountain range.  I mentioned the fact to my family; my wife and two teenage daughters, and we started to speculate what it could be.  We quickly discarded that the object could be a plane, blimp, weather balloon or cloud.  What was odd was the apparent size of the object and the fact that it was stationary, floating or hovering in the sky. I stopped on several occasions during the next half hour to photograph the object.  Traveling at an average of 80 miles an hour, we were able to see the object for over 50 miles, and still distinguish it clearly. The shape looked a little different from this latter angle, a shade appeared in the middle of the object that looked more cigar shaped than previous. We thought that it could be two ovoid shapes together or a peanut shaped object (see photos).   At approximately 10:10 AM two military craft were coming in from East to west over the highway. I assumed that they were military because of the fact that they were leaving vapor trails, and were flying side by side, a formation civilian planes do not oftenly practice. At seeing these planes, I asked my girls to see what the UFO would do and they mentioned that it had disappeared.  Because the mountain range was low in comparison to the height of the object, the fact that we were on a straight away, and the fact that we had observed the object moments before, we concluded that in fact it did disappear and was not obscured by the scenery.",

    "text": "Hi, my name is ((name deleted)) , Im 28 yrs old  and I have to share what I saw in January of 2001.  Briefly I can tell you this was in broad day light, I was comming back from Lowell MA with my friend and co-worker heading down 495 south. Traffic was pretty heavy so I was driving slow.  We were about in Berlin MA when my eyes started to drift and then became fixed on an object that was off in the distance, I stayed with the confersation that my friend and I were having when I knoticed that the object was comming closer to the high- way at a very strange angle and speed.  It was going very slow and very low.  It got so close that I finally became unable to talk, my friend noticed what I was looking at and both of us were in complete awe.  I remember realizing that about 100 people in traffic must be looking at this same object. By this moment is so close I can actually see the strange details on it's underside.  Im serious when I say it huvered from quite some distance away and ended up comming so close that even my friend who is an athiest admitted that it was nothing that he had ever seen.  There's alot more too this , Im an architectural AutoCAD drafter by trade and as soon I was in front if my computer I drafted what I and others saw .  Please get back with me so I can elaborate more , because I think I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that what I saw was not manufactured by a human being. \n \n -I have a very descriptive Draft of what this object looked like, because I was able to use AutoCAD (Computer Aided Drafting)to draw this, it is a very good representation of what I saw.

It was dark out, and I saw an orange glowing object up in the air, about a hand width above the distant tree line, over Three Rivers Park. It was glowing as if from within, and I could amke out a slighlty hazy flashing red light on my side of the view, and a white or pale greenish-blue one just on the far side of the object. There was a stopped vehicle with headlights on, that had pulled off the road, facing this object. I figured this driver saw this, too. I was cooking, so I had to tend to the stove, and then returned to see the thing still there. It was perfectly silent, I got my dog to stop barking for a minute, I opened the door, and heard no sound at all. He started barking again, and as I watched this object, it just disappeared! My dog stopped barking when it disappeared. My boyfriend had been in his office, and I had said nothing to him about this. I went to the TV to see if there was something on the news, meanwhile I heard my boyfriend say, \"What's that thing out there?\" Then he said, \"This thing out there was up in the sky and it just shot a white laser-like beam of light down to the ground, then disappeared!\" He described the same object that I had seen. I went to the door, and saw thatt he car was gone, or at least his headlights were off. I had checked the news after that, and there was nothing about that. I have not gone to the park to see if it left any signs in the snow, and don't want to, really, thugh someone should, I guess. After the object had disappeared, I noticed the normal air traffic had returned. Planes usually appear as tiny pinpricks of light, as do stars, but this was as big as a thumbnail held out full stretch.",

    "text": "Tiny object high in the blue afternoon sky, remaining motionless for 5 minutes \n \nMy husband and I were walking down the street when he pointed out a tiny white speck at an extremely high altitude up in the blue sky. It was completely stationary and remained so for at least five minutes. This was not a cloud. Although it was small it was a clearly defined object. I don't think many people had even seen it- you had to look very carefully. \n \nThe strange thing is that my husband has seen the exact same thing about 3 years ago in Seattle. He was looking out of his bedroom window when he noticed a white object high in the clear blue sky.  It hung motionless. He grabbed his  video camera and zoomed in. It appeared to be a white circular shaped object After a couple of minutes  it seemed to change into a series of 5 smaller discs, which rotated in a circular formation and moved ever so slowly , (still stopping and hanging in space once in awhile,) out of the range of the camera. (He still has this film but has never sent it in anywhere.) When I first watched it I was in total disbelief. I have never seen anything like it. \n \nMy husband had kind of passed it off as just a weird unexplained singular event, but  yesterday when both of us witnessed the same thing his previous experience seemed to have more credibility. \n \nWe're very curious about what we witnessed. Does this sound like some kind of satellite? Wouldn't it be moving across the sky steadily, and are satellites so visible during the day? \n \n((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) \n \nDear Peter, \n \nAll the information I can provide is that from the Richmond District of San Francisco (about a half mile \nnorth of Golden Gate Park) it was north/ northeast.  We were standing at about sea level and its elevation we cannot estimate, although it was extremely high in the sky, more than a mile at the very least. My husband actually says he saw it about 20 minutes earlier when he stepped outside the restaurant we were eating in. Then when we stepped out, he pointed it out to me. So it was there for at least half an hour, not merely five minutes. \n \nMy father is an airline captain in Seattle as well (he flies for World Airways) and says he has never \nseen anything like what we described. \n \nThanks for sending along your report! And my husband is now vowing to take our video camera along with us more often when we go out.   :-) \n \nBest Regards, \n((witness name deleted)) \n \n((END))",

They appear on friday nights in the sky over Burbank/North Hollywood Area.  The first sighting was one flying object on 11/29/02 by 3 people. Two objects were seen on December 12/20/02 by 2 people.  Three objects were seen on 1/10/03 by 2 people.  In all situations the yellowish/orange objects would fly from east to west in a controlled manner.  Eventually the objects would stop, flash, and disappear.  I work close to the airport in that area and have a good idea of elevation.  I can say that they are a little higher than commercial aircraft.  On 1/10/03 I called the burbank polic dept. to ask if there had been inquiries or if they knew of activity in the area and they had no data for any of the dates I mentioned. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  The sighting does not seem consistent with advertising lights, but we observe that the three sightings all occurred on Friday nights.

I would also like answeres as to what is really going on out there.I would be grateful and appreciate it if my story was entered into your reports. \n \nMayby there other people have also had simmiler experiences.Latley I have been seeing objects in the skys that are not supposed to be there. This happens often,especially in the late hours till the next morning.Id like to share one of my experiances with people who will take me seriously.One night about12:30pm , I went out into my garden because i couldn't sleep. I was sitting with my dogs when i saw movement in the sky i also felt there was another presance somewhere,I looked up. I saw coming from the east of the sky object moving slowly heading towards the southern part of the sky then going west.Firstly I thought them to be stars or satellights but then stars dont move left right up or down or change shape from big to small ,neither do satellights change colour or flicker.They were moving slowly about eight of them. When they reached the west direction in the sky they became totally still.Im not sure if they were in our skys or i saw them from space near earth i dont know how far unless they were very high up in the sky They were travelling in the formation of the star sign orion when they stoped some of the objects began expanding in shape and colour brightness and started zigzaging in there position in the sky Except for four which remained still and decreased in terms of size to a small stars.These four were in the formation of the belt of orion. Thats the three . The one object in the middle of the belt started to expand and emited a very bright light and then pulsated.After that they all broke up there formation of orion and seperated into different directions then dissapeared Id like to know what does their behaviour mean, and what is the significance of orion and why they made that formation giving special awarness to the belt if orion.I would like to know what star is in the middle of orions belt and the little one next to the belt.Is there a meaning to that part of the galaxy where orion is situated.Please inform me about these questions i have asked and also as to what is happening in the skys.I would appreciate it also if any one has seen the same thing or somthing simlir please email me at ((e-address deleted))",

    "text": "Flying saucer seen by 100 people at drive-in theater in Denver \n \nPeter, I thought you might like to hear about this incident even though it  took place about 25 years ago.  It happened to my wife, not me, but I have a better command of the language and will relate exactly what she described to me.  It is a fascinating event. \n \nShe was at the \"Mile High Drive In\" theater in Denver, Colorado.   Although my wife doesn't remember the year, she does remember that the movie playing was \"Dr Zchivago\".  Everyone there suddenly saw a huge flying saucer slowly rising up behind and somewhat to the left of the screen.  Everyone got out of their cars and watched as this thing slowly rose, with lights circling its perimeter, then came to a complete standstill, hovering.  As they continued to watch it just sit there, it eventually then tilted to a 45-degree angle and then suddlenly just ZIPPED out of sight in the blink of an eye.  Everyone was astounded.  That's it.  And of course she's been a believer ever since.  There is, however, an interesting little footnote to this event... \n \nAbout a year ago, my wife was watching an old UFO docu-drama on tv, and some lecturer or news reporter described exactly the event she witnessed.  This leads me to think the event was indeed documented, but I have searched the internet, and cannot find any such record of the event.  I would be extremely grateful to you, Peter, if you could provide me with any information about this event. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

But the reality of it is that I was not alone, I was with my best friend, and it really happened. For about a year, during this time we were in an unpopulated area of Maui, My friend and I would nightly see strange lights moving in ways aircraft just does not. Everyone we told riddiculed us. Except for the other people on our property. They had even more bizzare stories to tell us, but those are thnere sories. It was believed to be a spot in the world were other life was drawn to. \n \nAnyhow, One evening I was asleep, my friend in the bed, and I awoke with a sound of knoking in my head, maybe ESP? I looked out the window and quite close was a spaceship with colorful changing lights shining at us. I freaked out and punched my friend in the arm until she awoke. At that moment we both saw a figure standing at the end of the bed. Wewent under the covers and screamed for a while. then got out of bed as it was gone and the ship had backed off a bit. It stayed there until sunrise slowly backing away as we curiosly shined our flashlights at it. \n \nWe exchanged stories with one another and we both saw a tall figure with a huge head, she says she saw big eyes. This creature from another world had paid us a visit, without even using a door, though it did susconsciously knock. \n \nLater on in life we've talked about this, and also realized that many nights we had both woken up with aliens looking down at us and we were unable to move. The strange thing is how it happened to us both seperatly but only on the side of the bed that was not against the wall. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

Before I got there, she saw it by the moon (to our far left), about the size of a star and then it started to move North and down it enlarged. It moved quite a distance in a small amount of time, I came to the balcony and watched, by now it was directly in front of us. It continued to move to our right, suddenly stopping and dropping a white light. THe white light came down and made a burst of white light. The light then it continued to fall and another burst of white light came from the ball. It did this several times. The object in the sky then continued off to our right and straight up fading until it dissapeared. The object had a orange-red ball of light in the midst of it and you could see a dark outline disk type shape around the orange-red light. \n \nI can honestly say that I've had doubts before, but after seeing that, it was truly creepy. We are wondering if anyone saw this and if anyone could maybe know what possibly the white light that it dropped could be. \n \nThis was no plane, helicopter or satelite, seen it all, and it was none of that.

    "text": "Phoenix lights witnessed and documented two months prior to major sighting. \n \nOn the evening of January 1, 1997, we observed small bouncing lights in the Phoenix sky south of South  mountain.  The small lights roughly the size of a small magnitude star were bouncing around on the horizon.  Shortly thereafter we observed 5 bright lights flying over us in a V-Shape.  They were identical to that of the Phoenix lights which were videotaped in March of 1997.  The V-Shape lights flew from the southeast to the northwest towards Las Vegas.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.  After the incident I telephoned Sky Harbor Airport who referred me to Luke Air Force Base who in turn referred me to Peter Davenport of the UFO reporting center in Washington state.  We only gave my aunt's name to Mr. Davenport.  I was quite shocked to learn of the March 1997 sightings again.  I decided to again report this when I heard Mr. Davenport on KFI radio and called in to the radio station.  They put me on the air but did not further question me.  I was left hanging.  This sighting, two months prior to the sighting of the Phoenix lights needs to be brought forward.

    "text": "Glowing fireball  object crashed at Maverick's Beach \n \nThis event occurred in '94 or '95 when I was living in El Granada about 4 miles north of Half Moon Bay, CA.  \n \nI came home late one night between 12am and 2am. I sat on the couch for a few minutes when I noticed a strange object in the sky.  I walked out on my balcony and watched a glowing fireball like object hoovering next to a large radar dish located on a bluff on the Pacific coastline.  The site is located at the famed surfer spot know as Mavericks Beach and about two miles from my house.  \n \nThe object changes colors from orange to green to blue. It move laterally and vertically with great speed. I was so astounded and moved with a flood of emotion at what I was seeing tears actually fell from my eyes. I wasn't crying, I was in awe.  \n \nAfter about 20 seconds I began screaming for my family to come and see.  After I bit more of watching something very surprising happened.  This sphere suddenly fell from the sky behind the bluff followed by a large explosion like orange flash.  \n \nBy this time my family finally came to see what the commotion was all about.  I explained what I saw but they didn't seem to care and went to bed.   \n \nMy stepbrother and I stayed up to see if any other events occured.  After about 45 minutes we heard jet fighters over head.  They circled for five minutes until we decided to drive down to the radar station's bluff.  When we got there nothing seemed out of the ordinary.  We stayed for a few minutes and left.   \n \nI've never forgotten the events of that night.  It wasn't a helicopter, plane, flare or any other usual suspect.  If somebody's looking for a crashed ufo Ross's Cove would be where I would look! \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Near end of 1AM fireworks while standing outside Metro station in DC observed at least 5 cylindrical things moving at high speed across sky \n \nI attended \"America's Millennium\" celebration on the national mall in Washington DC New Year's Eve.  Up until 1:00 AM the weirdest thing I saw was a dumb guy climbing dangerously on a large tree.  I had no expectation of a UFO sighting then nor at anytime.  After the 12:00 fireworks and some music and laser lights (which were disappointing), I decided we (me and my friend) should start leaving, as the crowd was incredibly huge.  We walked through part of downtown DC including the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom Metro Station.  As we got near the station the crowd swelled again as people try to get to the few escalators going down.  It took a very long time to get to the escalator, so I stood and listened and people-watched.  At about 1:00 AM there was the sound of explosions and it made me \"jump\".  It was just the 2nd round of fireworks being launched from a barge in the Potomac River behind the Lincoln Memorial.  Thank God it wasn't real bombs.  All we could see were the flashes of light behind 12-story buildings and some reflections in office windows.  The fireworks lasted about 6 minutes, and after about 2-3 minutes of fireworks as I was inching my way along in the crowd, I noticed near the western horizon what appeared to be (a) shooting star(s).  I was not looking directly at it though.  I said to my friend, \"What good timing for shooting stars!  It's great to see that during the fireworks.\"  Then I saw more, and this time I got a better look at what they were.  (It also occurred to me later that the \"shooting star(s)\" never \"burned up in the atmosphere.\")  I saw a pair of dark but lit cylindrical objects \"flying\" in formation from NW to SE passing almost directly above me.  Definitely not meteors.  They looked identical.  They moved at high speed, but I was able to see them well enough while they lasted, since I was now looking for more \"shooting stars\".  Less than a minute later a single cylinder moved from WSW to ENE at about the same speed and had the same appearance.  I then ! said, to no one in particular and not loudly really, \"Am I seeing UFOs?\"  My friend was either caught up in the fireworks and/or crowd and didn't notice anything.  No one said anything after my last comment, but then very few people around me would have been able to hear me with so many people jabbering and the incredibly loud, echoing fireworks.  At this point I was almost at the beginning of the escalator.  I guess \"resistance is futile\"; I felt I had no choice but to get on the thing.  If I could do it over again, I would have grabbed my friend and tried to get out of the way so I could hang around and look for more of these things, whatever they were.  I have searched the Washington Post's of the last few days but have not been able to find anything on any UFO sightings.  I am now searching the internet for the same (for the first time) and happened upon this site.  I hope this helps me resolve what it was I saw.  I am keeping a wide-open mind and not jumping to conclusions.  Anyone else?  Please speak up if you saw them.  Thanks!",

    "text": "Light darting around over resevoir \n \nMy girlfriend and I were walking along the dam wall at the local resevoir. There was no moon and there are no lights around. Our eyes had become accustomed to the low light and we walked to a lookout. On the way back I looked over the resevoir and saw a light dart up then down below the range of hills in the distance. I stopped walking and watched and it flew up again, hovered with a shaking motion, then \"hid\" again. The object had a white light on the front, a red light on the bottom and a flashing yellow light on the back. At all times it was silent. \n \nI drew my lady friends attention to the distance and it obligingly darted into view again. It didn't seem to be affected by inertia and when stationary, seemed to shake as if it was between two repelling magnets. At one stage it dissapeared behind the range of hills and a vivid red light lit up the trees on the ridge as if they were on fire. Then it flew up, darted round then flew down to the water. A bright red light eminated from the front of it, not a beam, more like ambient light. After a couple of minutes it flew up again and started moving in our direction. It started off about 2/3 kms away and got to a few hundred metres away before I decided to leave. There was a feeling of danger and were glad to go, despite my curiosity. \n \nOne of the strangest things about the event was that as we left the house to start our midnight ramble, I had a feeling that we would see something and I said as much to my girlfriend. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

    "text": "lights over mountains chased by f-16's \n \nOne night my roomate amd I were out side on the patio. I noticed a yellow-orange light raise up over the mountains behind our apartment (Eagle Trace Apartments) and then just hover there. I was joking aroung about it being a UFO when all of a sudden 5 more came up to the same level one after another and spaced about an 1/8th of a mile apart all of them were evenly spaced and at the same altitude, about 100 ft. above the mountain. We lived right across the street from Nellis AFB and we could hear planes taking off. We thought they were just going out to the range but instead they headed twords the mountain. We thought ,ok they were just flares even though they were not over the range and this is when the lights faded to very pale blue lights and were much smaller in size, almost too small to even see unless you knew they were there. I dont think the objects got smaller. I think it was just the intnsity of the lights was far less. But anyway, as the jets, F-16's I'm pretty sure, got closer towards the lights, the lights went from hovering to heading left twords downtown Las Vegas at a high rate of speed. Eventualy we couldnt see the lights anymore because of the city lights but we could see the jets for a while. It was really weird. Another thing that has nothing to do with this night but I have always noticed about this mountain. This is the mountain right behind Las vegas Speedway. During certain times throughout the year there is something very shiny reflecting the sun on top of the highest peak on the far left of this mountain. I didnt see any antennas or anything up there. I used to notice it when I would come home from work at Nellis. Always wondered what it was, still dont know \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Several dark objects traverse the moon on the night it was historically closest to the earth. \n \nI don't remember the exact date but it was the night that the MOON WAS THE CLOSEST that it will be or has been in many, many years. In fact I think they had either Dr. Sky or one of those astronomers on the radio that night to speak about how the Moon was phonomenally close that night. \n \nI have a Red Pot Bellied Telescope that I bought from Edmonds Scientific so I pulled it out and decided to take a look. I set it up in the front yard and as the moon came up in the North East, I looked at it through the telescope. It was about 2/3rds of the way up the sky well above the neighbors trees. I am guessing about *;30pm or so because it was after dinner but the housekeeper had not left yet. Since I don't remember what season it was I can't really tell the time by the darkness, but I was cold, it may have been November or December, and it was definitely dark nighttime. \n \nWhile I was looking at it I suddenly saw several dark things go across the moon. It took less than a minute for them to cross the whole moon and I stared at them in amazement. It happened again maybe about 20 minutes later. I I didn't report it because I surmised that it must have been something close to the earth that came through my field of view. But they didn't flap like birds, but moved smoothly and all at the same time. When I saw them again they weren't in the same exact juxtaposition amongst themselves, but I still thought it might have been something close to earth, or perhaps satellites or something. \n \nBut when this guy tonight said that because they were in focus they had to be close to the moon, I decided to report it because they were in sharp focus. Several dark shapes against the brightness of the moon. And just as the guy said on the radio tonight, they would have been about the size of a pea if the moon was the size of a beach ball. But the optics on my telescope did not reveal any spherical nature, they simply looked like flat dark round or oval shapes, not all the same size because I remember my first thought was like a Momma and some baby birds, but they didn't have wings or appendages nor did they appear to flap. \n \nDid anybody else report anything that night? I am sure millions of people must have been looking at the moon that night like I was. In fact that's another reason I didn't report it because I figured if there was something there, then somebody else with a stronger telescope than I had would have reported it. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

    "text": "High SPeed Cigar Shaped Object - Sky Turning  Brighter Than Noon for 1000 Miles For Over 20 Secs \n \nI still have the news footage talking about this night... was mentioned right after the discussion of the loss of the Mars Lander crashing into the surfice.  At 5:13 that moonless night was walking out to get the mail... was facing the S/W sky.  I saw the sky was lighting up on the holizon... was as bright as if an atomic bomb had hit Atlanta 400 miles away... the light came towards me, and looking up saw that that were 2 clouds over my head and they were so fully charged with electrical energy you could see plasma like activity on the clouds.  The light in the sky continued to get brighter and wider till the whole sky was illuminated.  As the intensity increased i was able to look around and saw street lights turning off, and could view objects far away as if were high noon.  The light was not coming from any one location... rather the whole sky was as if suspended in cloud to cloud lightening.  The intensity after 15 secs was so bright -- that it was actually brighter than high noon on a sunny day.  The light was odd... made everything appear the wrong color.  Some pine trees near me appeared blue.... a blue shit was wearing had a green tint.. was like a the lighting a \"black lite\" gives... all had that odd tint to it.  Well 15 secs after the lighting had built to a peek saw moving across the sky at a VERY high rate of speed a cigar shape object...  the object appeared like something out of a 1950s B grade movie.  It had a metalic look to it... like a needle on the end.  It looked cheaply made .. but the speed was one of the fastest objects ever seen cross the sky and am aware this could have distorted my perception of the shape.  From the back appeared to be sparks like a fake spaceship would release in a B grade movie.  I lost site as the objected entered clouds behind me.  The sky remained illuminated for another say 10 secs. You could see the light receeding behind the object and vanishing back into the edge of the N.E. sky line.  About 5 mins later 3 fighter craft passed over and ! was obvious they were following the object and they vanished in the same area of the sky as this object had vanished towards slighly before. \n \n The offical news report said the object was seen from Montgomery Al. to past Asheville N.C. by 1000's.  The offical news release went on to say that while hundreds of calls were made to police and sherrif's depts across the flight path, that it was believed to be a meterior. \n \n While i saw no signs of any course correction... and as fast as the object was moving realize i cannot swear to the appearance... what has struck me odd all this time was a few things:  1.  The amount of EM energy that it would take to produce this much lighting. \n \n2.  The lighting in the sky came BEFORE the object by at least 10 - 15 secs at the peek. \n \n3.  Watching the clouds... the plasma moving on the edges was so odd. \n \n 4.  The craft was actually the least amazing part of the siting. \n \n 5.  Aircraft do not chase meteriors. \n \n I wish i had been able to take EM / mag readings during the passover or gotten some video footage of the event.  If you are curious have the WLOS TV news coverage with some police officers talking about it on this night and how freaky it was. \n \n I asked and never got a reasonable explanation to why the lighting came so long before the ~whatever it was~ and just how much energy it would take to excite what i assume is the ionasphere during this siting to be so bright for such a duration over so wide an area as this was seen. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

However, a few months back on a whim I looked up the word on the internet. It turned up in one language only, called Manx, meaning \"Highness.\"  I had no idea what Manx was or where it was spoken. I did some research and found out it is an extinct Gaelic language once spoken on the Isle of Mann off the coast of England. \n \n In one of Whitley Strieber's books, Transformation, that there was a possible connection mentioned between the Gaelic languages and the Visitors. \n \n I suspect that maybe I was \"visited\" at a very young age in Greensburg. \n \n There was one other incident, maybe around 1970 or 1971, where I thought I saw a purplish silhouette of a man (or something) standing outside my second story window.

I saw a silver or white obect which was in the shape of an elongated fairly thin cylinder either rounded or pointed at each end.  I do not recall seeing any control serfaces.  It was not an airship.  The sky was sunny but with patches of cumulus clouds.  The object was moving slowly west to east.  There was no sound from the object.  As I recall there was little or no wind at ground level.  The object was seen for approximately two to three minutes and then disappeared behind a cloud formation.  I alerted my friend about the object and asked if he saw it.  His answer was yes. \n \n I didn't say anthing to anyone else about the sighting but I have remembered it for all of these years.  Since I heard about your organization I thought it was time to say something about it. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "I'm not sure where to begin... \n \n My earliest memory dates back to when I was an infant.  I'm not sure how old I was but my next memory is my third birthday.I remember a gift that I got and I also remember having this first memory at that time.I can recall even at that age a want to hold on to it and I have. \n \n I am lying on my back in the grass.It is night and there is cool a lite breeze.I remember this because I could feel it blowing my hair around.It tickled my forhead.I felt very at ease and calm. \n \n The sky was so beautiful.It was filled with dozens of geometric shapes.There were many different colors and they had a soft internal glow that bordered on translucence.They were very soothing and I felt that they were my friends.I know that they were soothing me,like a mother would a child.I cant explain in words what I felt inside but it was like communicating. \n \n The duration is probably about 2-5 minutes.Throughout my childhood,it was always my strongest memory and inspired me in everything I did.I've always thought that it is what sparked my curiosity about sciece at an early age(got my first shock at 5 by poking around in a telephone outlet). \n \n Anyhow,when I was 13,I went to live with my grandparents as a result of my mothers death.I stayed in my dads old room.At about the age of 15,I started having weird dreams.There were so many that I cannot remember the chronology,but I will state some. \n \n One of the first was one in which I was having a dream about eating cereal.I thought I started to fall back in the chair and got that rushing,falling into oblivion feeling,that woke me up.I was lying flat on my back in bed and someone approached me from the left.I couldn't move.From here it gets a little foggy,from terror I think,but \"he\" lifted my shirt up to my armpit then used something to cut me just under my left nipple.It didnt hurt but I was very scared.I then felt a horrible,numb,type of pain.A pulling sensation coming from the area where I was cut.I couldnt turn my head to see,but out of the corner of my eye,I could see him pulling out a piece of tissue.The pain was incredible.That all I remember until the next morning.My chest was a little sore and I had light scratch in the exact area where he cut me.I also have no muscle in the lower portion of my left breast.I'm 25 years old today,I work out,and I still have no muscle in that area. \n \n Another dream is one where I wake up in the middle of the night.There is a pink hazy light coming from my window.I get up and look out.It looks like daytime on an overcast day except in pink.I look to see what time it is and my clock is not on.No power in the whole house,so I dont know what time it is.I had a very strange feeling at this point and decided to go outside.The sky was overcast and pink.Where I live was only a mile north of Rosenblatt Stadium and you could see it from the backyard.We also weren't to far from S.A.C,so on some days you could wee jets flying in that area. \n \nI went around to the back and was shocked to se the sky filled with U.F.O.'s.Discs,cylinders,pyramids,spheres,Etc.I also felt that they saw me,or better yet,were waiting for me.I dont remember anything after that. \n \n There are many more but I am no good at typing and am tiring already. \n \n One day I got up the guts to bring them up to my dad, \"jokingly\",and he later confided in me similar experieces he had as a young man in that house. \n \n At the age of 18,I moved to AZ and the dreams stopped.I moved back to a rural part of NE 1 yr later.I have been here for almost 7 yrs now.The dreams have started again and now they involve my young son.This also coincides with a recent sighting of a U.F.O.(it was on the news,on tape).I really wish they would stop.I call them dreams but honestly,there is nothing more real at the time.I've never told anyone else about them before,and feel kind of silly,but I need to get it off of my chest. \n \n I know this isn't a specific \"sighting\",but I had to get it out.Sorry. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

    "text": "This incident took place in 1967 or 1968 while I was stationed in Okinawa in the Air Force. I was assigned to maintain and operate a small 24 hour diesel power house at this very powerfull search radar site called Yoza Dake Air Station. We were loacted at the southern tip of the island and there was a Army Hawk missle site near us. One night me and a co-worker were coming out of a NCO club that was our late night mess hall as the regular mess hall closed at 7 pm. We had a Okinawan waitress that came out side with us as she was beginning to clean up the NCO club and she was coming out to get a mop bucket and a mop as she did almost every night. When we came out of the door she shouted out in Japanese ..OH My God. (OK Sami Yo).. and she ran back inside the NCO cluub. We were very astonished ourselves in the very large red/orange colored light that appeared at 25 -30 degrees above the horizon on the eastern side of the mountain top. We asked each other what could this light be from as it was not usual to see any light on the east side of the mountain as the Naha Airbase has a glide path on the west side of the island and our radar site. We asked each other who had a camera in the barracks which was only about 50 meters away. My friend ran to get his 35 mm camera and I stayed and observed this light alone for about 5 or 10 minutes. The weather was pretty humid and there was a slight misty rain earlier, but it was not raining when we saw this huge bright light. While I was waiting for him to come out of the barracks I was walking towards the rear door of the barracks and watching this light which is very bright. The intensity of the light seemed to stay steady. and it did not move at all and then it suddenly disappeared befor my co-worker came out of the door with his camera. We asked our radar observers that was on duty that night in the block house if they saw any boogies on the radar screens that night and they said no. But later after many questions some did admit the radar observers were! tracking this and some other boogies. Later after this incident one of the senior radar observers said they have logged many unknown boogies there over the years in a daily log book. We both talked about this openly with the 80 plus  staff on the radar site and some were open to discussions but most said they could not discuss these boogies as they were instructed by their officers to remain quiet about boogies. A very well known radio personally who was in the Air Force then was also there at this time. He was moonlighting as a DJ at a local NAHA radio station there that we all listened too called KSBK. He is the host of After Dark on the weekends now. I remeber there was newspaper articles in the local dailies as this light or lights were observed in many places that night and it scared alot of people. The KSBK radio station had radio news stories about this light that same night as we went back to barracks and listen to the DJ as the station received alot of call in reports. I visited the KSBK radio station during my 18 month stay there and I was able to meet the current weekend host of After Dark. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

    "text": "Incredible UFO sighting in Hoboken NJ around 1997-1998 \n \nI flew from California to Hoboken New Jersey to visit my grandmother in Aug 2001 and she told me of an event she witnessed. She could not give me an exact date, but it was around 1997-1998. At the time she was living in a 13 story apt building. The windows of her apartment face north and you can see the Empire State Building and the Hudson River directly to the right. \n \n At around 6am or so in the morning she awoke to the noises of car horns going off at street level, so she went to the living room to look through the window to see what the commotion was all about. She noticed, directly in front of the apartment complex, three disk shaped objects hovering at maybe 300 feet or so in the air! She described the objects looking like a wheel with spokes that connected to a disc or sphere in the middle. The area between the spokes, or bars, was open space. The crafts, she said, rather looked like an old fashion horse drawn carriage wheel. \n \n They were completely still in the air in a vertical position. She noticed people out in the street where also looking up at these objects and other people becoming aware of what was going on since it was very early and people were leaving for work. She had been observing the objects for 15 minutes or so when two helicopters arrived. The choppers stayed hovering in place for a while, and then began moving closer to the objects. The crafts started tilting into a horizontal position and then slowly moved up and away from the area while gaining speed till they where no longer visible. The helicopters pursued but could not keep up. The entire event lasted about 30 minutes or so, probably longer. \n \n My grandmother immediately turned on the TV to see if there was any breaking news about the sighting, but nothing was reported. For the entire week, she followed the news, including the newspapers, but nothing ever came up about the event. I’m sure that whoever was in the helicopters must have been recording the event with video or something. Needless to say, it was an incredible event for my grandmother to witness! \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Colaboration of 1978 sighting in Whittier, California (Southeast Los Angeles County). \n \nI was recently scanning thru old sightings on your websight and came across one of  great interest to me.  It concerned a woman who spotted a flying object over the 605 freeway in 1977 or 1978 (she couldn't remember exact date).  This sighting was actually posted in 2000, since the woman was new to the web.  Well, back in 1978, my neighbor told me of a VERY SIMILAR sighting that she had the night before.  She was driving home travelling south on the 605 Freeway (Southeast Los Angeles County) at 2:30 AM (the woman was driving north on 605 fwy), when she saw a bright light that she first thought to be a helicopter spotlight.  She estimated the object to be a couple of miles away.  As she drove south, the object was slowly flying north towards her.  To this day, it is a desolate stretch of freeway.  My neighbor slowed to a crawl as it approached, since it was hugh and obviously not a helicopted or airplane of any type she had ever seen.  She did not stop as it slowly flew directly over her at what she estimated to be 100 feet or so- VERY LOW.  She said it was dark in color and possibly triangle in shape and looked like some sort of \"hugh flying machine with lights.\"  She was uncomfortable telling the story and had NO reason to lie and only told me after repeated questioning of the slight sunburn on ONE side of her face- which she admitted she thought was caused by object.  I  am guessing my neighbor probably saw the same object that this woman saw.  I travel the same freeway about a dozen times per week and have never seen anything unusual. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was strange that it stayed with us for so long staying the same distance and height above the trees from us except when we turned off it crossed eaterly to the opposite side of the road. Although the timeframe was long neither my (now ex-)wife noticed any missing time. it was truly remarkable to us from when first seen it was so bright and moved rather rapidly but as it slowed and paralleled us through this little \"speed-trap\" town it got dimmer and changed from the bright full moon shape to the definite football shape. It seemed to us we were seeing it edge-on as it paralleled us. Numerous other cars behind us should have seen it also but noone stopped and watched but us. I had a camera with me but had used up the film. On a recent get together in Ga when my mother died, my ex-wife and I discussed this event and she seemed to remember it the same as I remember it. Later that month we moved to Texas. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Red, Green and  Yellow lights over the Pacific in Constitucion, CHILE. \n \nThis was my first sighting, I was travelling in my car and just out of curiousity I pulled the car onto the side road facing the ocean which there were strange lights hovering over the horizon, they were red, green, yellow and white lights moving in all different directions.  We observed these lights for over a span of 10 to 15 minutes, I happened to look up into the night sky and saw more than a couple of stars move, like when you see falling stars, except that these did perfect circular movements and just disappear afterwards.  After witnessing this we noticed that over the horizon of the pacific, quickly a kind of mist or clouds covered these lights and we could no longer see them.  After getting to our destination, as we got out of the car and as I looked up into the night sky, I saw behind the hills a kind of lightning or flash, this was on a clear starry night. \n \n Previously, the day before this, it was around midday.  It was a clear blue sky day, I saw a metallic object cross the sky, it looked like it was far since it was just a small dot, it was round and metallic, the speed of this craft was quite normal and just eased it's way across.  From these sightings I was told that this area in Chile, Constitucion, there are quite alot of sightings and it's very common to see events like this.  Since then I have not gone back, every night I look up and hope to find something interesting.",

I was walking my dogs in our local community centre and as they were playing about on the grass I was looking at the sky and thinking it was a beuatiful morning when a passenger plane flew over head. It was quite low as all the aircraft seem to be since 9/11 and it reared off to the right and then to the left and a few very short seconds later this object followed as if it had been behind the plane, but it reared off to the right and stopped for a very brief second and followed that path. The object moved across the sky in an elegant fashion and without sound and for a very brief second I noticed white vapour coming from the back. The object appeared to have no shape, it looked the shape of a star and it was a silvery gold colour. I watched the object till it was out of sight and it seemed to glide actoss the sky as if it had a purpose.

    "text": "Mysterious Red Blinking light of San Diego \n \nI was having a New Years celebration (2004) at my home. A few close friends had gathered. At the stroke of midnight we went back to light a Roman candle and some firecrackers. My yard faces north. On the hillside across from me a firework lit the sky drawing my attention up. I noticed a glowing red light, high in the sky. A first I thought it was a red flare, far away. Similar in intesity, pulsating, flickering. However, to my astonishment, It remained stationary. After several minutes I commented to my friends who looked at it with disbelief. We observed it for a few more minutes, when they exclaimed it must be a plane, or a flare that caught an updraft. Hoever to my eye it appeared far away, almost star like, however it pulsed and flickered much greater that any star I have seen. I watched for a while and grabbed my video camera. It was extremely difficult to view, except in night vision mode on my camera. It appeared to gain elevation slowly and to drift slightly to the east. after another 15min+ it flickered brightly and just dissapeared. 2 guests at my party commented they had seen the same thing a few years back, 3 of them (red lights) together in fact, even closer and to the south. I myself had seen something similar, 10 years ago over mission bay, with a yellow however I will have to make another report, I I just discovered this site. \n \n I have read up on the reports here, and I am dying for somekind of expaination. It seems to be a common phenomena in the San Diego region, and in fact an almost identical report came from a few years back in Spring Valley, even in the sam direction.

    "text": "Disk shaped object. \n \nBrian,  The event happened on Jan. 1st 2004 at or around 3:30 PM EST. My family and I (wife, daughter age 5, son age 2 almost 3) were on our way home from lunch and shopping. We had turned off of I985 onto Spout Springs Road (heading east) and I guess we were around 1.5 to 2 miles from the Interstate when my wife said \"what is that?\". \n \n It appeared to be several hundred feet up and my first thought was that it was a child's balloon--one of those reflective foil-like ones but the sun's reflection from the object was so bright and the objects surface appeared to be so smooth (like finely polished silver) that I got real curious. Also, though it was hard to tell, my wife and I both got the impression that the object was 4 to 6 feet in diameter. \n \n We passed the object by and turned around and came back. We actually turned into a side street to get closer and parked. From this vantage point we could clearly see it (not trying to drive and look). The object was moving slowing away from us (like the wind was blowing it though there was no wind at ground level) and it was moving on its axis. This is hard to explain...it would flip and roll sort of like it was tumbling but not consistently in any given direction. From this movement we could make out that the object was an almost flat disc. \n \n When it would roll to its thin side it looked black and there was no reflection. \n \n When it would roll and reveal its flat side it would appear to be silver and the sun's reflection was strong. It looked like polished silver in the sun. Also, in the middle of the object was a red color--a circle--my wife said it looked like a big silver button in the sky with a red dot in the middle. This middle dot area did not reflect the sun like the rest of the area around it. \n \n Also, I might ad that when looking at the flat side of the object, I mentioned before how it was smooth and silver...but it also looked solid. I mean it did not look like something filled with helium. I understand that in this we could have been mistaken but to us it honestly looked 'hard'. That along with the way it was moving on its axis (tumbling) made the object 'not fit'--what I am trying to say is that it is unexplainable to my wife and I. \n \n We observed it for several minutes as it was moving westward away from us (I am assuming it was West because it was heading back towards the Interstate). I decided to try and drive to another subdivision off of Spout Springs road to see if we could get under it. My wife was looking at it as we were driving away, she turned away and when she turned back, it was gone. \"It's gone\" she said. I looked all over the sky and it was just gone. This was the most baffling part to us. Our eyes were off of it only for a few seconds. \n \n Another odd thing...When we first saw the object, it appeared to be moving to the north-east. When we were at the place we stopped to watch, it was clearly moving more westward (which from the pace we had stopped was directly away from us). \n \n Afterwards, I asked my 5 year old daughter what she thought it was, she said that it was a CD (Compact Disc).  As far as she is concerned that is exactly what it was (a 4 foot wide, floating Compact Disc). \n \n As far as witnesses, there was light traffic moving along the road. Also, right across the street from the area we parked was two men walking up and down the side of the road looking looking as if they were looking for something on the road side that had fallen out of their vehicle. Neither of these people seemed to be looking at the object as their attention seemed to be on finding something in the ditch. There may have been trees in the way that obstructed the view for these guys. \n \n The area that this happened in is filled with thousands of homes from closely packed subdivisions. Someone else had to have seen it. There is just too many people living in this area for us to have been the only ones. \n \n To conclude...I do not buy the aliens from another world bit. However, I can't account for the object we saw. It appeared to literally defy the law of gravity.

The object stayed to our south the whole time, but sometimes was even with us, went ahead and even in back of us.  When we got to Epping area, a small flashing red light appeared to the right and another in front of us.  They would appear and reappear randomly.  At one point, the flashing reds changed their flash pattern and the bright white light to the south dimmed to almost nothing, changed to an orange color, changed to a flashing red itself, disappeared and then reappeared as bright as before,  We lost track of the flashing reds, but the bright white continued to dim and rebright and looked to be positioned over Massabesic Lake in Manchester, where we have seen ufos hover before.  We gave up the chase at this point, wishing we had a vidcam or binoculars with us. All three looked like they could have been stars, but they moved. The 3 observers are my mother-in-law ((name deleted)), my wife ((name deleted)) and myself.

I saw a distant object in my windshield that I initially thought to be a hot air balloon in the distance.  The sky was clear and without clouds.  I found it strange to see a hot air balloon as the temperature was only 4 or 5 degrees above zero.  I noticed the shape of the object change so that I no longer recognized the hot air balloon shape.  I mentioned it to my wife who started watching it also.  It then went back to looking like a hot air balloon.  As we continued to watch it became apparent to me that we were closing on the object faster than I would have expected if it were a hot air ballooon.  My first explanation for this was that perhaps it was smaller than I had expected so we were really closer to it than I had estimated.  As we continued to get closer I realized we were closing on it very quickly and as it passed overhead my wife was able to crane her neck and look up through the windshield.  I asked her what it looked like as we passed and she said that what she saw was a disk shaped object, metalic in color, and not entirely smooth.  The object did not have lights.  At the closest point the object appeared about the size of a quarter.  After the experience we tried to make some sense of what we had seen and have not been able to do so.

Seattle Wa and we observed an helicopter shaped object hovering 50 -100 yards in the air. The object made absolutely no noise and hovered with no movement (perfectly still) in the air for some time. The object was completely black but due to the overcast sky we were able to make out its shape in silhouette. It was like a helicopter but with out a visible propeller and it had two large square \"pontoon\" looking things on the right and left (from where we stood it seemed as though we were looking directly at the front or back of the object but i can not say for sure). When I spoke to my friend about it again last year he said that he remembers a small flashing light on the bottom of it but I don't remember this. \n \nWe were joined by a stranger an he asked \"Do you see that?\" We all started to point and talk about it when the object took of south toward the side of Queen Anne hill. More specifically, it was perfectly still no wavering-nothing, then all of a sudden with out any sound or unnecessary movement it was moving at high speeds(jet like) it did not seem to accelerate but was just going that speed. Within less then one second it reached the side of the hill, ascended to just the crest and over the hill out of our view. I would estimate it covered the ground of about 3 miles in the matter of less then two seconds making no sound. \n \nI will speak to my friend again and see if he can give me a more accurate date as I have can not remember at this time what the year was.  This is the first time that i have reported the event other then retelling the story to close friends because in the past I know little about things of this nature and well had trouble believing it myself. Recently I have heard about sightings of similar objects and as soon as I heard what they were called I knew that it was the same thing that i had seen, Black Helicopters. Now that I know other people have seen them I am going to start to let people know that these things are real and that something is happening that involves these objects. I have made some speculation as to what i think that they are but as a witness I think that it would be improper to speculate in the forum. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

From here I will discribe what I saw: It was a large clear sphere about fifteen feet in diameter and about four stories high. I remember the childern were crying with fear but all I could do was stand there with my mouth wide open starring at it. It must have remained ther for at least 20 minutes, I could see right through it and the stars behind it. It did have a thin cloud like substance on the bottom. The object made no sound and when if finnally took off it still made no sound but move extremly fast upward and over, faster and further than anything I've ever seen. I immediately went in the apartment and called called the police to report and ask if any one else had seen anything like I discribe. He said no and that was that.

    "text": "Low flying, zig-zagging disc with lights in the 70's \n \nI am telling this story as a second hand experience as told to me by a couple that is extremely good friends with my family- the couple babysat me as a youngster, I grew up with their youngest son, and they still remain very close friends with my parents.  The story begins while my family and the couple mentioned, along with their son, were vacationing up north on Portage Lake.  In the cabin one evening, we all decided to share strange occurrences we had experienced in the past- paranormal events and stuff like that.  I thought this was strange for my friend's parents to bring up because they are such content, sincere folks- the type of people one wouldn't associate with UFO sightings.  Anyways, they started off by asking one another if they remembered what they called \" the flying saucer\" in the field back about thirty years ago.  Then they proceeded to tell us the story of the disc they saw during the seventies over the field that is only a block from my current residence.  As I describe the story they told, I will refer to the couple as \"Dan\" and \"Ann\".  Here is what they told myself and my family of their experience:   \n \nOne day (unsure of exactly what season they said) Dan was riding his bike back from the local grocery store a few blocks away.  On his rode home, he noticed a large, blackish-metallic, low flying disc with lights around its perimeter near the water tower down the road from the grocery store.  Being only a few blocks from home, he peddaled home, as fast as he could, with the water tower and stationary ufo on his right and the field and his home on the left (Dan and Ann's home at the time was right at the field's edge).  Dan immdeiately got Ann to come and see the spectacle outside.  When they both got back outside, the disc was over the field, moving slowly in the direction of their home, then it stopped.  Dan and Ann watched the disc for several minutes, as it slowly changed direction, heading back toward the direction of the grocery store Dan had just came from.  As it! flew, it slowly spun (I am almost positive they said it spun) and was outlined with greenish-yellowish, almost fluorescent lights. During flight, it silently zig-zagged slowly back and forth while still heading in the same direction.  Dan and Ann watched the disc until it flew out of sight.  They never heard of anyone else seeing it or of any reports in the newspaper or on tv. \n \n~ These people I have known my entire life telling me of this event now, to me, makes the phenomena of UFOs and otherworldly life a reality.  Another thing that the couple emphasized in the telling of their story was that the disc moved as if it wasn't effected by the same scientific barriers as we on earth currently are- the way it zig-zagged during flight effortlessly gave them the distinct feeling that this craft was either other-worldly or far, far, far ahead of its time. \n \n(the date, time, and year of the sighting are mere estimates- I am absolutely sure that it was in the 1970's, though). \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I didn't feel like sleeping so I knelt in my bed and leaned on my windowsill looking out at the city. Almost at once there was a small dark gray or possibly metallic ball moving steadily past my window. It was about 8-10 inches in diameter and had no distinguishing features at all. There was no sound or light associated with the ball. It was probably about 6-12 inches away from the side of the building and moved from left to right, which would have corresponded roughly to moving north. Our apartment was on the 15th floor and the window faced west-ish. (It faced in the direction of central park from the east side which is roughly due west.) The ball was not moving very quickly and I remember thinking that if I ran I would have time to get my babysitter to show her the ball before it had moved past the window. Which I did but of course when we got back to my room it was gone.

    "text": "UFO Seen Manuevering in Impossible Ways with No Apparent Reason \n \nI was camping on a mountain called Wing Mountain which is WSW of the San Francisco Peaks outside of Flagstaff, Arizona.  My friend and I watched a flying object for several hours and witnessed its presence as long as five hours after initial sighting.  The object made no sound that we could hear.  We were at the top of a small mountain with a continuous, nonchanging rise to the area on the other mountain where the object was.  In other words, we were in a bowl shape that would have channeled sound very well.  The object was in the sky and about half way from the bottom of the mountains to the top.  The bottom of the mountain where the object was is also the bottom of the mountain that we were on.  It repeatedly flew in a \"T\" shape.  It would fly straight back and forth for at least 10-15 minutes and then drop at a perfect right angle down into the bottom of the \"T\" shape.  It would then resume the back and forth movement after coming back up to the plane it was moving in horizontally.  The object had a light that could best be described as an amber light resembling a street light in color.  The intensity of the light decreased significantly as you look away from the center.  The light appeared like a round ball of evenly dissipating light.  The light stayed one intensity, but would increase approximately 10 seconds before the object descended into the bottom of its \"T\" movement.  There would occasionally be a red light that seemed to be attached to a lever that was  connected to the object in the middle.  The lever would look stowed into the vehicle and normally not be visible, as there was no red light visible.  As the object came up out of the \"T\" pattern, the lever with a red light at the end would sweep 180 degrees, from horizontal at the rear of the vehicle to horizontal at the front, and disappear.  The red light appeared to swing down from out of the craft, swing in a half circle and disappear up into the front.  The angle at which the object descended in its \"T\" movement pattern was a right angle, not an arcing angle like a helicopter or balloon would follow.  Also, the amber light was bright enough to see over the forest on the mountain.  We could barely see shadows in the trees(I have 20-20 vision) moving as the object moved above the woods.  It resembled what one would see from 2 miles if a military flare to expose enemies was released, but a dark amber in color, just bright enough to see the tree shadows moving if you look slighty to one side of area being lighted up.  The light was not bright enough to easily see in the woods by looking straight at them even though our eyes were adjusted to a very dark sky.  The object never left the one spot where it was first seen.  The \"T\" shape that it moved in appeared to be approximately 100 yards or less in length across the top, and about the same distance down the vertical leg of the \"T\" shape.  It appeared to be maybe 200 yards above the forest on one end of the horizontal, and about 150 yards above towards the front.  I fell asleep and did not see the object depart unfortunately.  The \"T\" shape would be perpendicular to the mountain, meaning, as you look straight to the top of the mountain, that the object approached and then moved away, as opposed to moving back and forth relative to the top of the mountain.  I am an electrical engineer and am quite certain by the angles at which this object moved that it could not be hovering by manipulating air.  Also, I know of no aircraft that can silently move at impossibly right angles for over five hours without refueling.  Plus, this mountain is all a National Wilderness Area with no military activity that I have ever heard about.  The nearest military base is the Navajo arms depot about 20 miles away, west of Flagstaff.  I believe that everything approaches infinite mass when approaching the speed of light and that living beings cannot live long enough to travel the distances necessary at the available speeds to reach other planets.  Therefore, I am truly perplexed by this event.  I really hope this information helps us learn more.",

    "text": "Solo driver witnesses oblong, rectangular object w/ lights moving to the north above freeway \n \nIn the beginning of January 2005 (I forget the date) at 5:24 pm while driving southbound on Interstate 25 south of Denver, Colorado I saw an oblong object in the sky, flying (what seemed to be very slowly) above me, northbound directly up the highway. \n \nIts size and speed was hard to determine, not knowing exactly how far away it was, and because there was nothing I could compare it to, I could not make a determination.  It seemed to be anywhere from about 20 feet to an undetermined length, and it seemed to be doing anywhere from 10 miles per hour to an undetermined speed, and it seemed to be anywhere from 100 feet high to an undetermined altitude.  If I had to guess I’d say it was about 50 to 100 feet long and about 200-500 feet above me, and was traveling at about 40 miles per hour or maybe a little faster. But this is just a guess...it could have been bigger but it was impossible to determine. \n \n My first impression was that it was a bunch of Canadian geese flying in ‘line-abreast’ formation, because I had just seen (a minute or two earlier) a ‘V’ formation of them flying north.  However upon closer examination, what I saw was not a group of individual birds flying in a line, abreast, but it was a solid object.  I then thought it must be a piece of black polythene or polyethylene caught in the wind like a kite.  However upon closer examination I was able to determine that it was solid and ‘plank-like’.  It kept its rigid form and in no way fluttered or flexed or was jostled or buffeted or affected by the wind or breeze.  It held its course and form. \n \nI say it looked black because at that time of evening, it was silhouetted against the sky.  It could have been some color for all I know, but it appeared to be black.  I noticed two small ‘bumps’ on the leading-edge of one end of what I’ll call this ‘wing.’  These small protuberances for lack of a better definition (other than ‘bumps’) were not exactly the same size but were almost the same, and were immediately adjacent to one-another.  My thought was that if this was some random piece of junk caught-up in the breeze, then it would not be completely symmetrical, so I immediately checked the opposite end of the leading edge to see if there were bumps there also.  I saw that there were an identical set of bumps in exactly the same place on the other end. \n \nThis object looked like a board, flying sideways up the highway above me. Not exactly streamlined for sure.  In fact it was the most un-aerodynamic thing you could imagine. Certainly not something that would work in a wind-tunnel. I could see clearly that it had 90 degree corners and features.  It had no perceptible camber nor rounded edges.  It was not ‘airfoil-shaped.’ It had no anhedral nor dihedral nor sweepback. Its form and the speed it was flying defied Bernoulli’s principle.  It had no separate fuselage nor engines nor tail/empennage nor visible flight-control surfaces, no external anti-torque devices, neither did it display any lights or markings.  No perceptible intake or exhaust, no props, jets or rotors, windows, vents nor antennas. There was nothing attached to it nor hanging out of it. What I saw was unlike anything I’ve seen, heard or read about.  Just picture a giant, black, symmetrical board moving in the sky, steadily in one direction. \n \nI could not relate to it in any way except to feel (mere speculation here) that for the lift and thrust and weight factors of aerodynamics, it must utilize some undisclosed type of technology such as magnetics for propulsion/stabilization and to overcome gravity, and ionization of the atmosphere to overcome drag through the air.  I was unable to hear any sound from the object, because I was inside my car amongst traffic in the fast lane.  There were a couple of vehicles pulled-over on the side of the road at this point, but I didn’t really take my eyes off the object long enough to see if the occupants were watching the unknown flying object also.  What surprised me the most was that I didn’t hit my brakes and create a major traffic jam or accident, but rather just calmly thought: \"Now that’s curious.\"  Some have talked about dimensional shift, dematerialization technology or thought projection, but I can’t go there at this point because it’s a little beyond my paradigm. \n \nI’m guessing the duration of this sighting was about 20-30 seconds from the time I first saw it off in the distance to the time we both ‘closed’ on each-other and it went overhead while I craned my neck, and pressed my face to the windscreen to watch it as long as I could before it disappeared in my blind spot overhead because of the roof of the car.  Even though the thought seemed ‘silly’ to even contemplate from the scene I was witnessing, I consciously looked to see if there were any wires or poles supporting this object as the suggestion crossed my mind that maybe all it was, was some object hung over the highway, and the movement was due to a ‘relative motion’ illusion.  There was nothing I could see to support this idea at all. Besides the object was moving relative to the highway also. \n \n I was as conscious and lucidly awake when I witnessed this event, as now when I’m writing this description of the event.  I have no idea what it was, nor do I have the slightest clue if it was our technology, or where it came from.  I’m totally at a loss to explain what I saw. Kinda cool though. \n \n((name deleted)) \n \nSketch of what I saw. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in January 2005 is approximate.

He joined the Air Force in 1950 after 2 years at the University of Minnesota and spent some time in Korea as a jet mechanic and then came stateside and was stationed at Souix City Iowa, were he was trained as a radar technition.   \n \nOne night in 1954 the whole base went on alert suddenly and they were told there was an unknown object coming from the north.  They got a radar reading that it was at 50000-80000 feet and traveling in excess of 1,200 mph (I recall him saying 1,800 mph but my brother said 1,200 so we'll go with that).  It went off the screen to the south, and everybody in the room was told to forget it even happened.  He never told us or anybody else about that before, but my mom confirmed today that he told her about it the next day (he was on the overnight shift).

    "text": "Very large UFO, irregular in shape,  glowing red-orange craters, below cloud level, no noise,  reported in paper as space debris. \n \nI realize that this is a very old sighting, but felt that it was too significant to not share with others, and see if there are any other reports of it on record. \n \nI was approximately 15 years old when I saw this UFO.  It was approximately 9:00 PM.  It was a moonlit night, and there were many cumulus clouds in the sky that were bright white from the moonlight.   \n \nI was sitting outside my house with 4 of my neighbor friends when I noticed a very large object slowly drifting across the sky.  All of us saw it.  The object was extremely large; much larger than a blimp.  I would estimate the size to be at least 100 yards in length.   \n \nAt first I could not tell the altitude of the object but then realized that it was very close because it blocked out the clouds as it silently drifted over us.  I listened carefully for an engine noise, but there was none audible.   \n \nThe object was irregularly shaped.  The best way I can describe it was that it looked like a large rock; appearing at least 4 times larger in diameter than it was in height.  The object was rough and had many craters (resembling the texture of asteroids I've seen photos of).  The craters emitted a dull glowing red-orange light.  I could not actually see the source of this light, the light instead seemed to be reflecting off the craters of the object from a source within it.  The object did not vary in speed, direction, or altitude.  The object was visible for at least 5 minutes before it finally drifted out of sight. \n \nDuring the sighting I knocked (no banged) on several neighbors doors to have them also witness what my friends and I were seeing in the sky.  When the neighbors would come outside to find out what was going on they were awestruck with what they saw in the sky.  It was no doubt to any of us that what we saw was not of this world, and was a UFO. \n \nThe next day I looked in the St. Petersburg Times Newspaper for information about what we saw the previous night.  I was sure that many hundreds of people must have seen the same thing we saw in the sky.  I thought that surely it was reported by many people.  I finally found a very small article in the back of the paper that said (to paraphrase)  \"There were numerous reports of an unidentified object in the sky last night.  There is no need to be alarmed, it has been confirmed that this was only space debris\". \n \n\"Space Debris!!!\" I thought...... Well this was no space debris.  I am sure that the object was within our atmosphere because it blocked out the clouds as it drifted overhead.  The object had no wings.  It had no engine or propulsion device that I could see nor hear.  This object should have fallen to the ground if it were space debris, but instead it defied gravity and drifted across the sky. \n \nI am sure that this sighting must have been reported to UFO reasearchers by others that also witnessed it.  I did not save a copy of the article that I read so recently I attempted to search the database of the St. Petersburg Times to find an archive of this article but the database online does not go back that far.  I am hoping that there is eveidence on file of this sighting.  Could you please tell me if you have any record of this.  As I mentioned this was a very large UFO and plainly visible in the evening at approximately 21:00 hours.  The Date is just an estimate as I was a teenager at the time and guess that I was approximately 15 years of age. \n \nThank you. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

    "text": "Historical sighting (1903 - 1913) Northern Missouri \n \nMy grandfather and his brother related this story to family members long before reports of UFOs became widely publicized.  The date is a 'best guess', as my grandfather (born in 1893) was a teenager at the time.  It could have taken place anytime between 1903 and 1913. \n \nGrandpa and his brother were hunting \"out in the woods,\" as they described it, somewhere in, or near, Adair County, MO.  They spotted a light ahead of them which appeared to be swinging back and forth in an arc.   \n \nAt first, they believed it to be someone swinging a lantern, then decided that it was too high and the arc was too big for that to be the cause.  They ran ahead to investigate.   \n \nWhen they reached a clearing in the woods, they saw a large, metallic, disc or saucer shaped object hovering above the ground in the clearing.  I can't remember if my grandfather said that the disc itself appeared to be swinging back and forth in an arc pattern, or if the light(s) on the disc were moving in such a way as to cause this illusion.  I believe he also said it seemed to be emitting a humming noise. \n \nShortly after they came into the clearing, the disc/saucer rose very rapidly, straight up above the trees with a \"whooshing noise\" and took off horizontally, at a great speed, disappearing from their view.  They walked to the spot, above which the craft had been hovering, and discovered four large, circular burn marks on the ground. \n \nI remember my parents and other family members talking about this incident when I was a small child.  Then, sometime in the late 1960s (perhaps as late as 1970 or 1971), my mother had purchased a copy of a National Inquirer with a photo of a UFO on the cover.  One day when my grandfather was visiting us, he picked up the Inquirer and said, \"This looks just like what I saw when I was young.\"  He then proceeded to relate the story to my brother and me. \n \nMy grandfather was a man of high integrity, and everyone in the family who heard of his experience did not doubt for an instant that he was telling the truth.  The craft's shape, speed and flight behavior prove that it was clearly not a zeppelin, nor a balloon, nor any type of airplane which would have been in existence at the time.   \n \nI submit this in my grandfather's memory because he was so interested in finding out exactly what the object was.  It is also my sincere hope that relating his experience might help in the serious research of UFOs, if only to establish that a sighting had occurred in the very early 1900s. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was across the street from my high school football field when Ilooked up and nearly had a heart attack when i saw the object hovering over the football field.  I was so scared and surprised at what I was looking at that I could barely get the words out to my 3 friends to get out of the car and look at this!  \n \nIt was a Saucer shaped object of metalic looking structure with detail around it on the bottom that appeared to be holes of many in numbers and small. It was so close to the ground that I would say to be approxmatly 50ft. or so.  \n \nI at first as did my friends try to find an explanation that would discount what we were actually seeing and then we all gave into the reality of it and accepted the fact that we were wittnessing an event that would haunt our memories for the rest of our lives.  \n \nI and my friends got back into the car as the object began to move to the east very slowly.  We followed it for about 20 minutes as it gained altitude and speed until it in an instant it accelerated from an estimated altitude of around 200 to 300 feet to out of sight in 2 or 3 seconds or less.  \n \nI am a God loving rational individual and believe in everything in the Bible and that is what keeps me feeling safe from any possible event that could harm me while I await the rapture when Jesus returns.

    "text": "1 slow moving UFO rising from East (ocean) to West, on straight path, rectangular/cylindrical shape. \n \nAt the time I resided at a house on Deauville Close, Yorkeys Knob, (near Cairns), Queensland, Australia.  I remember I was in primary school, but I can't remember the exact date of the event, I'm pretty sure it happened in 1980, but I'm not sure of the day/month.  It was in the evening, my family was having dinner, I was late & they were calling me for dinner.  I was looking out my bedroom window, I liked to look at the stars at night, the blocks next door were vacant bushland and I had a good view of the stars.  We lived on the beachfront, there were some dunes covered in scrub between our house and the beach.  I remember this event so clearly, it haunts me, at the time I was mesmerised by it.  I called out to my family - \"mum, dad, come look, there's a UFO!\"  They didn't come, they were eating, and laughed at me from the other room.  To this day my family still sometimes recall my \"story\" and still make fun of me.  If only they had seen what I saw that night.  The UFO did not look like any picture of a UFO that I've seen - it was a different shape altogether.  It rose from over the low bushland near the sea, I first saw it when it was about 10 or 20 metres above the ground, I watched it come in from the East/sea, and it moved along a straight path westward, slowly rising.  It seemed to fly so amazingly low, near my house it seemed to fly above the block next door (that I was looking toward from my bedroom window), my bedroom was on ground floor, and the UFO seemed only about twice the height of the black wattle tree next door - probably only 20 to 40 metres up in the air - I couldn't beleive how close it was.  Somehow it then continued it's path westward, gliding more towards the south west gently, getting higher and higher, it rose over the tall trees of the swamp at the southern end of the cul-de-sac, and I could no longer see it over the horizon of trees/swamp.  It glided along a smooth straight path the whole time, and it moved so slowly.  I don't know exactly how fast it moved, it seemed like the pace of someone pedalling along on a bike, maybe 2 minutes?  It seemed forever, but I think that was because of the mind bending experience.  As for the UFO's appearance - it was NOT a saucer.  There were no little green men.  I did not seen any aliens at all.  But it had a soft glow around it.  The outer seemed greyish, but my eyes were focused in it's front face - you could see into the front of it, but all I could see was a light pale soft yellow colour, there was no detail.  It was cylindrical in shape - the same sort of shape as a rectangle, but with rounded edges, and not very deep.  It was smooth all over, rounded at the corners, and I could only see into the front, I don't remember seeing into the back (it was a long time ago).  The shape was sort of like this (it was rectangular, like a long/thin/wide cylinder, kind of a cigar shape from the side, but rectangular if looked at from the top or bottom): Side view: --------- |         | ---------  Front view: ----- (     ) -----  Underside or top view: --------- |         | |         | ---------  That's the best sort of scale I can get using typed characters!  Remember it was smooth in shape and edges were round, not sharp.  But the front view did have notably rounded sides, like the '()' characters.  To this day I know I saw it, but I doubt myself all the time and it has messed with my self confidence as a result, I was double check things that I do now as a result.  But I know what I saw was a UFO.  It also made NO sound, which was spooky as it was so close to the ground and my house, it made no noise at all. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.

I recently have not scene a UFO but I have had experiences in the past worth wording. \n \nIn the late 60's  Im thinking 1969 I would of been 8 standing in our front yard in Mt Washinton Maryland with my father,mother and next older brother we saw what looked like a cigar shaped balloon with what we thought was a person on a bicycle making a propeller move this craft.It was not too far away..less than a quarter mile,but we kind of had trouble making it out.It was not a plane and now I realize this was not a bicycle powered balloon either.Next years later age 13? I found myself outside my house in Towson Maryland in my underware at around 4am wondering why Im out here..I never have had a problem with sleep walking...nothing strang seemed like it had happened. Many years later 35 now I was living at a friends house in Mt washington Maryland ...my room in the basement I may have been abducted I cant tell if it was a dream or did it really happen? Im not sure but for some reason I keep recalling a very brite light like if head lights were shining in the sliding glass door in the room I was sleeping in. I think I came to in the backyard at the same time as seeing 2 dark saucers darting away over the tree tops.I went right back in and went to sleep but I felt like I had been through some trauma.It didnt seem like a big deal at that time but that dream or whatever it was keeps coming back to me.Sometime after that I developed an anal fissure which doctors thought were hemroids for the longest time...could this fissure be from a alien exam? Other strange things are the humming in my  right ear or right side of my head which started around 2/2000 that no doctor seems to have a anwser or solution for..it comes and goes and I havent had the humming for around a year now..maybe a few brief times since.Its more like an electrical hum from a large transformer.Lastly I have an obsession for ufo's and anwsers,I found out Im really good at algebra and math in general..I didnt even carry a notebook my last year of high school ..they wanted me gone..lol I was in the cop out program my last 2 yrs of high school.I did finish college with a degree in computer networking though 2002.I always have thoughts like I may have been programed or Im being monitored.If anyone else has simular experiences or you have some possible anwsers let me know.

    "text": "Unusual experience in Florida in 1954 \n \nAt aprox 1am in 1954 I was awakened by a light shining through the window directed at me. This was 10 miles out in the country, closest neighbor half a bile. I went to the window and the light followed me where I saw a disk hovering above the ground about 20ft. It had lights around the bottom in I believe warm colors. I watched for over an hour looking for some kind of beings and did not see any. The light became more intense and that is the last thing I remember until waking on the floor by the window at daybreak. I was 14 at the time and related the story to my dad at the time and we went down to the area where I said I had seen the craft and we found the usually wet swampy ground to have become hardened like pottery in a roundish shape similar to the size of the craft. After that time I watched for the craft again and never saw anything like it but I began to feel differently and more attached to my own life (could have just been the age at the time?) Anyway I have listened to you on CtoC many times and thought of reporting but just got around to it. \n \n Several years later in Calif when I was returning to my apartment about midnight I saw a similar craft crusing along about 500/600 feet above but it had a short tube up to a small ball on top of it from the dish like craft, same lights beneath. At the time I was a student pilot and called the Lond Beach tower and the Lakewood sherrifs office and they had nothing.

Suddenly, mr car stopped. I stepped out and looked around to see if anyone could give me a jumpstart. Suddenly, I heard weird pinging sounds. I looked up and saw three saucers zipping through. There were green trails where the aircrafts had flown by. They were in a tight triangular formation. Suddenly, four or five more saucers in loose formation shot out from the clouds after the previous UFOs (which I think they were). Suddenly, a light shot out from one of the pursuiting crafts after the ones that had previously zipped by. It hit one, and it instantly blew up. When the green phosphorous light caused by what I think was a missile cleared, there was no more light there. From the rear, more missiles shot out. One of the lead UFOs took a sharp banking turn (the light started dimming, which I think means he turned away) and the missile just continued on its path. The other one took a critical hit, and the same thing happened. There was nothing else. The four or five planes in the back seemed to have disappeared because it didn't glow anymore, but later, I saw flashing lights, which I think were indicator lights. Therefore, I concluded that only the first three planes were UFOs. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

We went upstairs to take a peek at the disneyland and knott's berry farm firework displays when something catches my eye. At first i thought it was plane passing over but then it stopped and seemed like it was hovering really really high. Then a plane passes by and that's when i knew it wasn't a plane. It had a redish-yellowish-orange color to it. Seem like it was a rotating light. Was weird beacuse uually under the city lights you don't get to see much space events like the stars so it had to be a really bright object. It brought back memories when I saw a similar object about 2 years ago that appeared in the sky and changed colors then disappeared. The recent one was similar to it but moved around more. It would move then stop then move and stop again then it just disappeared. We looked around in the sky searching for it when we saw another one in more towards the north-eastern sky. It was just like the one before and a plane passes by their (planes going to LAX) and the object stops. Moves around a little and change colors to bright yellow to red to orange. It seemed like it got closer but then zoom back then just hover and then disappeared a couple minutes later. I got these suspicious lights on my camcorder. Tried the besti could to get some good footage but im not a pro. The video i took u can distinguish the color of it and a really bright light. I just wanted to know what this object/s are.

They did not appear to be emitting any light of their own, but possibly reflecting the light of the city.  The color of the objects was a muted pinkish hue, about the same color as the haze on the horrizon glowing from the city lights.  For this reason, I first thought the objects were clouds or smoke from New Year's Eve fireworks, but then I realized that the sky was perfectly clear, and 2 of the objects were changing shape in what appeared to be a controlled movement.  There was one object that appeared to be flying signifcantly higher than the other 2.  This object did not change shape.  It appeared to have wings, and looked like it could have been an aircraft, but it's shape was unlike any civilian aircraft I have seen.  The other 2 objects appeared to be lower than the first.  They followed the same path as the object above them.  These 2 objects were amorphous.  They were somewhat tubular and long, and kept twisting and contorting themselves, moving towards each other and back away, at times meeting with each other to form new shapes.  They were not moving very fast.  They were in view for about 1.5 to 2 minutes.",

Besides, it should have grown larger and eventually flown overhead if it really were moving in our direction. This object was apparently stationary.  I brought it to my boyfriend's attention and as we were watching it, the lights quickly dimmed (within approximately  a second)and the object seemed to disappear. There were very few light clouds and it was still light out and the object was definitely no longer there.  My boyfriend said that he could see a dark patch against the sky where it was for a couple of seconds before that also disapeared completely but I can't confirm this because I had to revert my attention to the road ahead.

    "text": "Four individual lights moving rapidly across the night sky,  at common interval, all in same direction \n \nI was walking our dog around the neighborhood, like I do every evening.  It was New Years day and I had heard a few fireworks earlier that evening, but considering the date everything was quiet.  The sky was mostly cloudy, but with areas where stars could be seen clearly.  I was walking down the street in an Easterly direction looking up at the stars when I saw a white light traverse the sky, approximately  from south to north.  There was no object visible just light, illuminating the cloud cover from behind.  The light moved very fast, in a straight line across the sky in about one second.  If I had not been looking up I would never have seen it.  At first I thought it might have been from a search-light, like auto dealers sometimes use, but the movement was too fast crossing, the sky in one direction only and with no visible beam projected from the ground. \n \n I continued watching the area, and within less than a minute the light appeared again, from the same approximate point in the South following a streight course to the North.  Again I continued to watch, ane within less than a minute I saw the light again a third time, on the same course and speed.  I watched a little longer, but didn't see anything more so I continued my dog walking.  As I apprached the end of the street, at a slightly different heading, I looked back again at the sky and saw a forth light, traveling the same path as the other three. I then returned home. \n \n As I stated, there was no visible object with any of these four light sources.  Rather the light appeared to be projected from behind the clouds onto the surface.  The lights appeared rectangular, with rounded corners, dimensionally the length appeared to be about three times the width, although this could have been an illusion caused by the speed the lights moved.  Ther was no sound associated with this incident what so ever.",

    "text": "Strange sights in the sky over Oahu from about 1994 to 2004 seen by long-time resident \n \nI'm so glad I found this site.  I was born and raised in Honolulu, and have spent a lot of time outdoors looking at the night sky.  I am sober; I don't use any drugs and seldom drink.  Over the years I have seen a quite a few things I could not explain in the skies above Oahu. I'm glad to have a place to share them here.  At the times these things happened I was either alone, or with one person and it was wierd not to be able to talk about them. \n \n ABOUT THE TIMES AND DATES, THE FORM HERE DOESN'T FIT.  THESE THINGS OCCURED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 1994 AND THE PRESENT AND VARIOUS TIMES AND LOCATIONS ON OAHU.  MOST WERE ONLY WITNESSED BY ME BUT ONE OR TWO WERE WITNESSED BY OTHERS. \n \n First of all the most recent thing was in the ocean outside Waikiki.  This occured approximately around 2002 or 2003.  On more than one occasion, I saw lights I could not explain in the ocean outside of Waikiki.  I saw these from Kaimana beach on the eastern end of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head.  There were yellow lights.  They did not behave either like airplaces or boats.  They were above the water. If I remember correctly they looked like flares (Although they were much larger, larger and brighter than stars or airplanes).  Their movements made no sense.  If I remember correctly, they burned brightly in one place and then sank slowly and disappeared before they hit the water.  They were perhaps a mile or more out to sea, seemingly directly out from Kaimana.  I saw these bright yellow lights on more than on occasion.  If I remember correctly there were more than one in a row.  My friend, a social worker, also saw then and we were freaked out. \n \n Perhaps around 1994 I saw the most spectacular thing.  It was twilight at Queen's surf in Waikiki.  To the West, out to sea from Makakilo and Waianae, hundreds of feet up in the sky, I saw a spectacular display.  Fluorescent green squiggles appeared high in the sky, one after another.  They would fade and more would appear.  This went on for a while.  It looked like someone air brushing designs on a T-shirt.  This was NOT the \"green flash\" people sometimes see in Hawaii after the sunset.  In spite of the fact that thousands of people should have seen this, I found no mention of it in the media, and I checked. I think I also checked somewhere like Bishop Museum which has astronomers and people like that.  No one else reported it.  One friend speculated that it must have been was rockets or missiles launched from the military base on Kauai [which would probably be Barking Sands].  This occurance was spectacular,unmistakeable, distinct and went on for a while. \n \n At other times, I've seen lights in the night sky that seem to behave in odd ways if they were to be aircraft.  This could be their movement, or brightness.  Most of these I've seen from Kahala or near Sandy Beach.  Perhaps some from Waikiki.  I don't remember the details that much now, just thinking, that light isn't moving correctly for an airplane, or it looks too big.  If I remember correctly most were yellow light, or perhaps white. \n \n Somewhere in the early or mid nineties, I saw the most incredible sights at Waimanalo beach in eastern Oahu.  These may well all be natural.  I just thought they were spectacular.  On this particular day, I saw an awesome rainbow coming straight down from a cloud to the sea.  About sunset, which was taking place on the other side of a mountain range, a sight appeared in the eastern sky about where the sun rises.  This on the horizon was over the water.  Black rays emanated from this spot, like a reverse sunset.  Lots of people saw it, they just looked transfixed, but no one said anything, strangely. Combined with the rainbow and something else I've forgotten, the energy was intense that day.  It was special.  I would be grateful to know what that was, if anyone knows. \n \n Then, between about 2000 and 2002, I saw one more thing.  I was near Punchbowl.  It was probably between about 3 and 5 in the afternoon.  This cloud came overhead, but it was not like any cloud I have ever seen.  It seemed unusually radiant and important.  It resembled a city in the sky.  I was transfixed by it.  I remember I wanted to call an aquaintance who is spiritually sensitive and religious because I thought she too would understand that something was afoot.  I don't think that was an ordinary \"cloud.\"  I've wondered in it concealed a UFO, or something else. \n \n That's all I can specifically remember at this time.  I've noticed other reports on this site of strange lights over the ocean outside of Waikiki that are like my stories.",

    "text": "Multi colored object, split into 3 lights, then split into 2 white lights northwesterly of Mercer Island, WA \n \nAt around 6:45pm this evening I was outside on our porch smoking a cigarette, looking into the western sky towards the Seattle area. \n \nI noticed an unusual star, or so I thought at first. After watching this 'star' for about a minute, I noticed it moving in a southeast direction at a very slow speed. I could see with my naked eye, several different colors flashing, so I thought it must be an airplane of some sort at a fairly high altitude. \n \nI am very knowledgeable regarding aircraft, since I am a licensed commercial pilot and former flight instructor. \n \nThis 'aircraft' did not appear to be moving at a steady rate of speed. \n \nAfter watching this 'thing' for several minutes, it suddenly split into 3 different and distinct lights. I could not make out what exact shape they were, and at this time I called for my wife to bring out the binoculars. She quickly came out with them and I focused them as quickly as possible. By the time I got them adjusted, the three lights became only one, with the same blinking. \n \nWe watched this 'thing' for the next 15 or so minutes, me looking through the binoculars and my wife with only her eyes, it suddenly split into 2 distinct lights, one white light shooting straight into the atmosphere, the other white light shooting in a northerly direction. \n \nThe rate of speed could not be calculated, but it was only a matter of maybe a couple of seconds before the objects were both out of sight. \n \nNo noise was heard, and I suspect the objects were many miles away and at an altitude again, that could not be judged, but it was most likely above 18,000 feet. \n \nThe sky at this time was clear, and the big dipper could be observed to our northeast direction.  Other stars were visible also. \n \nWe then went back inside to eat dinner, and around 730pm I went outside to see if this 'star' was still in the general vicinity, but, of course, it was gone. \n \nI've been flying since 1975, hold a commercial license with single engine, multi engine, seaplane, and CFI-II ratings.

    "text": "Light with erratic flight pattern \n \nMy boyfriend and I had taken a trip down to Fortescue beach, which is very quiet during the winter months.  At night you can see the lights of Dover Airforce Base across the Delaware Bay.  We were just standing on the beach talking and as I always do I was looking up.  The sky seemed to be very active with planes, and I am always on the lookout, epecially on Fortescue beach, perhaps to just to catch a glimpse of a low flying plane heading in or out of DAB.  We were on the beach or sitting nearby from about 6:30 until 7:30PM  It was already dark. \n \n My boyfriend is a skeptic and has never in his 51 years seen anything that he could call a UFO. \n \n The temperature was about 40 degrees with no wind.  There were some low altitude patchy clouds that seem to be making their way out as I was seeing more and more stars.  There was a slight amount of haziness to the atmosphere, perhaps later in the evening it would turn foggy, but Dover was still visable. \n \n I was watching one light that was about 30 degrees up from the horizon, waiting for it to turn enough or for it to get closer so that I could see the strobe lights blinking and confirm that it was indeed an airplane.  It was white, perhaps a slightly yellow color.  It was out over the water, apparently and about 20 degrees right of the last row of visible lights at Dover.  I was facing for the most part West, perhaps slightly South.  I watched the light move at a what seemed a normal speed for a plane, moving \"right.\"  I noticed what seemed like some irregularity in it's speed as it continued moving to the right.  It seemed to slow and speed up slightly, but it was not very obvious.  It then shot up and to the right slightly and very quickly at about a 70 degree angle of accent and about five degrees up.  I then alerted my boyfriend who had been looking elsewhere, never taking my eyes off of it.  We both then saw it move right and slightly up a few more degrees more quickly than the first time I had seen it, but it's erractic speed was more apparent.  It then shot down at about a 45 degree angle with the erractic speed still visible, even though it was moving quickly, only going a few more degrees and then it turned a sharp \"v\" turn, maybe 15 degrees from being directly vertical and much more quickly than before, shot up, got about ten degrees and disappeared apparently into the low lying clouds.  We looked for it, but it was gone.  We watched the sky for half an hour more but never saw anything else like it. \n \n I had a similar experience about a year ago, listed on this website, in Millville, New Jersey, which is about ten miles away. \n \n About fifteen minutes later we had gotten in the car to get warm and were still watching the sky.  We saw coming at us another light, but saw the strobe lights, from the same area of the sky as the unexplained light.  We watched it for less than a minute and we could tell it was headed straight for us, guessing I would say a few thousand feet up.  I watched the white part of the light \"turn\" and get very bright as if a helicopter had made a turn to go right at us.  But it was still too far out to hear the engine.  The light \"turned on a dime\" and we both agreed at that point that it had to be a chopper.  It headed over us within a minute, seemed to be roughly a thousand feet up or more, and we could hear the engine of what sounded like a prop plane, and not a helicopter.  I'm not an expert on planes, but we both got the feeling that we were being checked out, and just assumed that it would be a helicopter, epecially the way it appeared to make a turn directly toward us without having to \"circle around\" like a plane. Perhaps the light \"turning to face us\" makes sense to others who will read this. \n \n There are several houses near the beach but there were only two homes that appeared to be occupied with full time residents.  The road along the beach was otherwise empty of cars. \n \n We have discussed making further observations at this location and I will further document any occurances here.",

This is the 4th time I've seen a light like this.  (I previously reported them last year.)

My husband, mother and myself watched the light and saw it elongate and appear to be a craft with 3 lights.  I called a friend who lives approximately 1/2 a mile from me and she and her husband went outside to view the lights as well.  We watched them for about 20 more minutes.  During this time another craft seemed to come from behind the first one that looked identical to the first one and it slowly separated from the other one and moved further across the horizon.  Then they both seemed to fade out.  I'm not sure that I can rule out a helicopter.  There was no sudden erratic movement of either.

    "text": "fast moving Triangle with no sound and orange lights, stops hovers and speeds off. \n \nWhile taking out the trash on cold winter in 1988 or 1989 I was watching and hearing the planes fly towards from the west towards ohare. With it being crisp you can hear every sound. I saw a large triangle with orange lights approaching fast from the south, but it made no sound. It was much higher than the planes but not by much or it was just so big it appeared closer. I stared at it as it stopped suddenly overhead. It just stopped and was still. The orange lights were lit around the perimeter of the triangle. I was gripped with fear waiting for a beam to come down. But then it moved slowly south across my neigborhood but was still silent. I ran after it as my sight was getting hampered by trees. Then it sped off towards the south east at a high rate of speed and was out of sight. It never made a sound. As soon as it was gone I could hear another incoming plane. The sound of the plane comes much before I can actually see it. I waqs standing there staring at the sky mesmorized by what I just saw. I have not told this story to many people and never reported it, until now due that I saw the same traingle in a UFO story on tv and it sent chills up my spine. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

    "text": "Triangle formation in foothills. \n \nI lived up at the top of Briggs on Freeman, way up by Angelese National Forest.  Very few lights, very little people.  I went out of my house to walk down the street to babysit the neighbor's kid.  I was in an astronomy class in high school, so every time I went out at night I checked the skies to identify constellations.  I looked up, as usual, and saw over in the north-northeast three \"stars\" in a triangle shape.  It stumped me, because I could figure out what constellation it was.  I remember thinking something about the Summer Triangle; most likely that it couldn't be the Summer Triangle because of the time of year or location.  I assumed it was a constellation that wasn't easily seen in town, and I was just lucky to catch it on a clear night, up in the foothills where there were no lights to interfere.  I went on down the street to babysit. \n \nA few hours later I returned home.  It was close to 11:00 p.m. or so, and I again looked up into the sky.  The same \"constellation\" was in the same location.  I knew at that point that it was impossible, after several hours, those stars should have moved.  I stopped to watch them.  I noticed they were brigher than the other stars.  As I watched, the three points of the triangle came together in the center, scrambled around each other, then shot off in three different directions at an incredible speed.  Needless to say, I was a little freaked and ran into my house. \n \nThe next morning I heard my parents talking in the kitchen before I got up.  They said something about not mentioning anything to me, because with my imagination it would scare me.  Years later I asked them both about the incident.  They both remembered that my father had gone outside after I had left to babysit.  He went to close the garage door.  He also saw the lights.  Something happened, he never did tell me what, but whatever it was was more than just three \"stars\" up in the sky, otherwise there would have been no need to protect me from what was seen. \n \nSo, apparently I saw them in formation, went indoors, and in the interval between my two sightings of them, my father also saw something.  Maybe they broke formation and scrambled off, like they did with me, but for what ever reason they came back in time to put a show on for me when I went back outside. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

    "text": "Silent Red Light of New Years \n \nMy wife and I were watching the New Years festivities on TV last night and noticed that our neighbors (through the woods) were shooting off fireworks. We decided to peak out the window to share in their revelry and noticed this red light passing through our field of vision. This was at 12:00AM. At first I thought it was a red stray firework light but it continued heading North East from our location. We watched in amazement for around 10-15 seconds and then ran outside to see if the light was still there. And it was. For at least another 45 seconds to a minute. Then we finally lost it through the trees as it approached Aberdeen Proving Grounds. \n \nThe light was red and did not pulsate but rather stayed the same brightness as it silently moved across the sky. There were no tails to the light which ruled out a meteorite and there were no light drippings as would be seen from a flare or in our case, firework. It was difficult to determine how high the light was in the sky but it appeared to us that it was either lower than a normal helicopter or plane, or it was very large. \n \nWe've been looking all over to see if anyone else had seen this occurrence. Please let us know if you hear anymore on this",

    "text": "A group of six watches and videotapes seven UFOs flying over Northern Virginia minutes after the start of the New Year. \n \nUFO Incident Report January 1, 2011   Six of us were celebrating the New Year at our home in Northern Virginia. We were all in the living room, watching the countdown to the New Year on television and were waiting to toast the event. The ages of the people were as follows:  One male 13 year old One male 15 year old One male 24 year old One female (approximately 23 years old ) One male 48 year old One female 48 year old  At approximately 12:02am, we all stepped out onto our deck to scream “Happy new Year” and to listed for others celebrating with fireworks, etc. Almost immediately, someone in the group shouted, “look at those lights!”  We all looked South and observed four orange lights in the shape of orbs. The lights appeared to be more or less, evenly spaced from left to right (East to west) and were clearly moving Northward, toward our location.  Two of our group began to film the objects with cell phone video cameras, while all of us talked and shouted over one another, identifying the obvious reasons why these objects could not be aircraft or other known manmade crafts. Those observations will be detailed below. \n \nAs the objects came nearer, I (The 48 year old male in the group) decided to run down to the basement and get my video camera. I obtained the camera and went into our backyard, below and in front of the deck, where the rest of the group was still positioned, observing the objects…. Now, considerably closer than when I had left. As the objects continued to get closer, I could see that they were somewhat offset, as well as spaced apart. More specifically, there was one in the lead, the second was a bit off of the left and back and so forth. The “formation” was similar to military aircraft formations. \n \nAs the objects began to pass overhead, the rear most one, began to dim at a constant pace until it appeared to vanish before our eyes. The remaining three continued on and flew over our heads and ass that happened, the trailing object began to increase its speed dramatically. That object was moving directly toward the object that was second in line and it appeared as though the last one was going to collide with the middle one. It sped up and raced right up to the middle one and appeared to pass within inches of that object. As it passed, it’s light began to dim and then the object vanished. Moments later, as we watched the remaining two objects continue North, they both dimmed out and vanished as well. With the lights out, I could still see the unlit object continuing north for a moment, until it was absorbed by the darkness. \n \nAs all of us were talking over one another about what we had witnessed, someone directed our attention to the south, where we observed three more objects heading toward us in the exact same fashion. These objects were duplicates of the four that we had just seen. The 24 year old male in the group shouted, “I’m going to go get my laser light, and he ran into the house. The rest of us watched as these three orange lights continued north toward us. As they were at about the 2 o’clock  position on the horizon, the rearmost object dimmed it’s lights rapidly until it literally vanished before our eyes. The remaining two continued toward us. \n \nThe 24 year old male returned to the deck with his laser and activated it. There was a brief exchange regarding the law forbidding pointing lasers at aircraft. He proclaimed what we all knew, that these were not aircraft and the law did not apply. We quickly discussed the possibility of an alien misreading the laser as a threat and the 24 year old stated that he was sure that they would be able to identify it as a simple beam of light. With that, he directed the green laser at the rearmost object, which was now passing directly overhead.  All of us were surprised to see the object illuminate with the green reflection of the laser beam. Seeing this, confirmed that the objects were much lower and smaller than we had originally thought. The two objects continued north to about the 10 o’clock position and then simultaneously dimmed out and were gone. \n \nItems Of Interest:  There is a commercial flight path within sight of this location, however it runs from south to southwest. There has never been a commercial or private aircraft that has flown in this path, since we have lived here. That is almost six years. \n \nAll of these objects flew directly over the Quantico Marine Base. This base does not have a lot of aircraft activity. In the past 5 and a half years, I have only seen four helicopters and no fighter/fast mover type of aircraft. \n \nAll aircraft are required to display one red and one green light, in addition to landing lights while on approach to an airport. There were no green, red, white or flashing lights on these objects whatsoever. These objects were illuminated with an orange light. \n \nNone of us hear any sound associated with these objects. \n \nNone of us had any physiological or psychological reactions, other than great excitement, to these objects. \n \nOf our group, three of the adults believe in and have observed UFOs in the past. The 23 year old female did not believe in UFOs but has been profoundly affected by this experience. The two children have witnessed unexplained lights (with the adults present) in the past, and seem stressed about the possibility of the lights being associated with alien life. \n \nThe 48 year old male is a retired “Big City” police officer and is currently an investigator for a federal agency. He is also a Veteran Army Paratrooper. Because of the sensitive nature of his career, he is deeply concerned about being identified. \n \nFive of the people in this group are related. Husband and wife, father and three sons, Three of the adults in this group have had multiple UFO sightings throughout 2010.",

    "text": "Possible balloons with ignition sources launched over Mentone for New Year's celebration. \n \nI live in Redlands, which is about 6 miles EESE of San Bernardino, CA. \n \nAt a little before midnight New Year’s Eve, 2010, I went out on my east-facing front porch to listen to the celebratory noise. \n \nApproximately 00:05 am I observed two glowing objects rise from the NNE from my vantage point. \n \nThe objects were, to my eyes, about as bright, and were about the same angular size, as the planet Jupiter (when it is on the zenithal arc). \n \nThese objects seem to have risen from NE Mentone, the next town east of Redlands. \n \nThe atmospheric conditions caused them to slowly rise, in an apparent north-westerly direction. \n \nThe sky was overcast with some low stratus and cumulus clouds.  I was able to track these objects for about 10 to 12 minutes before they entered obscurity in the clouds, or their inherent light source went out. \n \nThe two objects appeared to originate from the same ground location.  Their apparent angular separation ranged from about ½ degree to 2 degrees. \n \nMy supposition is that they were large balloons carrying an ignition source well below the balloons themselves (to keep from burning the balloons). \n \nThe light they gave off was mostly white, with a slight reddish tinge.  The time of their disappearance was approximately 00:20 am.  From the time of first notice, to final disappearance, they traveled approximately 55 degrees azimuthally. \n \nThought I would write this in case anyone else saw the same thing. \n \nAbout midway through November, in the late afternoon, I saw two similarly-sized objects, with about the same apparent luminosity.  They, however (or at least at the time I noticed them), were separated by about 30 degrees, and had much different trajectories.  It is quite possible that their point of origination was also in NE Mentone – perhaps these were test flights?",

    "text": "Just wanted to report UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sighting over SLC with a extremley bright orange aura. I know the sound of choppers and planes. I also know light patterns that these aircraft must use. There were no blinking lights and no green lights in the this sighting. I am a beleiver of outsiders but of course i dont fear them, but it was very interesting seeing this object flying upward (vertically), not horizontally. Afterwards, I saw 3 choppers scattered around the valley make their appearance shortly after my sightinging. Then I saw a superfast object with blinking lights (green and red).... either a jet but im thinking it was a sattelite trying to pickup the trace. I saw it above the northern part of SLC. Not sure if it came from Wasatch Mountains or from the city itself. When I stepped outside seeing it at the beginning of my sighting I would estimate it's altitude from the ground at ~ 5-7k feet up. I noticed it as I headed to the front door! and heard the neighbors making racket of the new year (which i dont mind). I'm 20 years old and I have had 1 OTHER EXPERIENCE where i saw a UFO 30 feet away from me. Take in mind not to associate UFO with aliens but with an unidentified object. Never been so scared and startled in my damn life from the previous experiece. But thats another story... \n \n-------- So the facts are: -Very Bright orange aura ~ 5-7k feet above ground when i first saw it -Had no blinking lights at all but a strong solid orange glow! -Was heading upward with slight zig zag movements at one point then went straight up -I never saw a speed increase but it's hard to judge at that distance -I watched it until it left the atmosphere.... I have very good eyes and i watched it until i could not find it in the sky. \n \n-3 hellicopters appeared around the valley( I'm from delaware and i know choppers)... They wernt regular news choppers or anything. I'm thinkin military but THAT is just a GUESS -saw a very fast moving object with blinking light ~ 5-10 min afterwards move right past where the object was moving. I beleive this to be a satellite high in the atmosphere scanning. \n \n-------- I saw something of great importance but email me back or call me if u find anyone else that shares the same sighting.

Showed a witness who was sitting down on floor who saw it out window from there sitting position. I ran to get camera but the square shape Fire in middle U.F.O. was gone and should of been able to see it. Then Monday around 2 O'clock on channel 9 MGN news reported like 5,000 black Birds found dead all over Illinois on roofs of peoples homes. Then another report of about 5,000 certain type of fish was found dead New Year Morning. I can't confirm it was 5,000 Black Birds and 5,000 Fish my numbers can be off. I am not sure fireworks all over Illinois do that to just Black Birds or a certain type of fish. Well, I can't confirm this was a Chinese Candle or Moving Flares. I was! thinking this was an Invisible object that powered on to get away from the Fireworks (maybe). Why just black birds and a certain type of fish? I think what I saw had to do with these dead Black birds and Certain type of goldfish. I am going to find about now about this dead animal report. I think U.F.O. it was headed toward Mount greenwood near Chicago. Look about 40 feet long dark red square craft with fire in the middle. It was around 1000 to 2000 thousand feet hight in the air. Moving about 175 miles an hour I am guessing. Find the news WGN report was played January 3 2011 WGN News Chicago about the dead birds and animal found everywhere. Hope there is other who heard this story on the 3rd of January and I hope others saw the UFO on New Years after Midnight during the celebration.

They appeared to be in a V or backwards check formation. There were two crafts to the right of the center or lead craft and four on the left side. As I continued my observation, it appeared that the formation was gaining altitude as the lights were beginning to fade. The lights completely faded out where I could no longer make out the individual crafts and it now appeared as a large glowing orb.

At first I thought that a flare got caught in some kind of wind current and was moving in a southbound direction. \n \nHowever, I found that the flare was not extinguishing and seemed to be winking periodically. Then, all of a sudden a next one appeared slightly more north easterly and vectored to intersect the first one, which just disappeared.  \n \nAt this time I am wondering if this is some kind of balloon with a flare attached. The fireworks somewhat stopped but this thing began to change direction and even slow, and then rapidly turn east, then slow again. \n \nIt was only when the object paused (10 sec)right in front of my house (about 200ft up)I suddenly realized that this was not a flare because its form became visible and I was looking at what could only be described as a glowing red ball but the light was moving through out the body of the ball. \n \nMy wife and I observed this thing until it flew out of sight changing direction often.

At one point we wal! ked by another woman who was also witnessing this phenomenon, and she expressed how she had never seen anything like this, either.  We aren't sure if this continued on, as we were cold and tired and headed into our rooms. \n \n I later contacted the FSS and was told that the surface winds were very light, and winds at 500 millibars were southwesterly at 10 knots(at 4 am).",

    "text": "red lights over miami florida \n \nI am reporting a sighting I had on January 01, 2011, at approximately 1238 a.m. location is Miami Florida. I observed five to six objects flying from south to north on the western side of the sky. The objects appeared to be at different altitudes from each other but in formation. They where approximately at 45 to 50 degrees from the horizon. At first I thought  they were meteors. However, I observed them for 35 to 45 seconds. \t  I used my binoculars to take a closer look. The light they emitted were the  color of road flares and were very bright. They would dim slightly and become bright again. The altitude appeared to be to high for a helicopter and was about the usual altitude that airplanes take when approaching an airport. I could see the light appeared to be located at the bottom of the craft and there were no navigation lights on the craft. I have seen fighter jets flying at night and these did not appear to be jets. They were traveling at a speed slightly faster than a commercial jet and maintained a straight course except for changing altitude. I lost sight of them due to ground obstructions. \n \n Approximately 10 minutes passed and I observed one more object flare up and take a similar flight course to the previous 5. I observed this object for approximately 25 to 30 seconds until I lost sight of it due to ground obstructions and light pollution. \n \n I called a someone who was in Orlando at the time and told that person what I had observed. This person observed something similar approximately 10 to 15 minutes after my incident. I hope someone else observed what I did and maybe can provide a logical explanation.",

As I watched the fireworks, I turned the opposite direction and began to walk towards the house, when I noticed a strongly flashing star above the tree line.  Having seen my share of satelites, planes, shooting stars and whatever else you can think of, It immediatly caught my attention as something more. \n \nI watched as it began to move from side to side in a jerky motion.  I ran inside to get my boyfriend, and we ran out and watched for a good 15 minutes as it flashed and pulsated. It was far enough in the distance, that we couldnt make out any direct shape, but the pulsating flashes and irregular dashes too and fro; as well as the way it seemed to almost completely dim, then flash to life again in blues,and yellows and red. What probably made me even notice it the first, is that the light stood out so strong against the light pollution/city smog.  It stood out so srongly, where other stars and planes were lost in the orangish haze.  This light pulsated, and hovered to and fro, for near 15 or twenty minutes. I only wish it would have been closser to make out further details. it was undoubtably something strange.. and no way could anyone pass it off as 'weather ballons'.. or anything else.",

    "text": "Witnessed approximately 70 flaming balls travel across the eastern sky in a semi circular trajectory. \n \nOn the night of January 1, 2011 I picked up my girlfriend from her place of work, off of S. Clinton St. across from the Doylestown train station.  The time was approximately 10:25pm EST.  We proceeded to drive south on Clinton street making our way towards Hart Ave.  While continuing down the hill I noticed numerous bright objects in the eastern sky.  It was immediately evident that this was at the least something uncommon or unusual.  We made a left turn at Hart ave. and pulled into a parking lot behind a bank.  At this point we both exited the vehicle and stood in the parking lot to get a better look.  The time at this point must have been about 10:27pm EST. \n \n Initially we saw about twenty of these objects moving relatively slow from south to north across the eastern sky.  They were following a semi circular trajectory, appearing out of the dark in the southeastern sky, moving towards our position slightly while continuing north.  After covering much the length of the sky, they began gaining altitude and moving away from us before disappearing again into the darkness.  They continued in a constant stream like this for about ten minutes, with new ones appearing in the south east as they disappeared to the northeast.  For the most part, at any point in time there was somewhere between 15-20 of these in the sky at once.  They all followed the same general trajectory but individualy they carried there own paths(almost as though they were travelling in formation and connected by a string).  As they made their way across the sky, most of them maintained their relative positions to each other.  However some of them were bobbing around.  ! They all seemed to maintain a constant speed the entire time.  At 10:36 a placed a phone call to mother for her to meet me in town and bring a camera.  At about this time the lights started to appear in fewer numbers.  Eventually dwindling to about 2 or 3.  Finally the last one went across at about 10:40.  Of interested note, shortly before the last one went across the sky my girlfriend and I heard the sound of a jet, but did not visualize any planes. \n \nAt no point in time did the objects make any type of noise, additionally, they moved unlike any aerial manned objects I have ever seen. \n \n The objects themselves looked like balls of fire.  Some were slightly larger and brighter than others.  They ranged in color from a deep red to bright yellowish-orange.  However all had an appearance similar to that of a campfire at a distance.  They almost looked like bioluminescent deep sea creatures moving in the pitch dark of the ocean. \n \n It is difficult for me to judge the altitude of these objects, I can say they appeared to be flying much lower than a typical commercial liner. \n \nInitially when we first exited the vehicle, I freaked out on my girlfriend because she didn't know how to use her crummy camera phone(blackberry), however we did get it working and managed to snap a couple pictures.  The pictures by no means do justice to what we saw, and the actual objects appeared much brigher, larger, and in greater numbers. \n \n I have read stories and seen videos of the chinese lanterns, and though they look similar, I stuggle to understand how they would appear/disappear, change color/size, and follow a semi cirular trajectory.  I am also unaware of any local group that releases such lanterns. \n \n Additionally, there was some light fog with an overcast sky.  It was difficult for me to tell how low the cloud cover was.  About 30 minutes after arriving back home it began to rain.",

One short, one medium and one that was taller than the two. They looked in on me and ducked out of sight as I looked to see them. Just out of sight. I never got up to even investigate. I knew they were only spirits. Yet much like the aliens we see on TV. So a night or two of visits and I just prayed and rolled over as I might if a demon or something was around. I knew faith was my only protection. Then the taller one on the third night came in my room just before time to sleep. I rolled over but watched him as he came around the end of the bed. He took the image of a device or sensor and stuck it in my knee. My body went paralyzed for a brief. Like an epidural shot. So I just waited until I felt ok. No real problem since he left right after that. Never opening any doors just appeared in my place. The next night the little on came up to t! he side of the bed nearest to my head and I could see him but like always knew he was in spirit form so I’d never be able to touch him or defend myself besides faith. He got up kind of close, about a foot, if even that much from me and said the word”THC”. I smoked right much marijuana back then so it wasn’t a surprise to hear the reference. Then he said a word I’d never heard before “Transduced”. I had a dictionary in the drawer by the bed. I looked in it right away for the meaning. Low and behold it means “by supernatural means” to travel in spirit to another place is to transduce yourself. I knew that I had really seen Aliens in my home. Then years later I had a bone spur in my heel. I worked at a temp service and was working extra hours on a good paying job. I had put in overtime and 12 hours that day even. My heel was hurting on the cement floors all day. Another alien came into my sight. In spirit and said he was send from God. He asked me if I wanted him to make it go! away. I just thought back to him. I think telepathically the ! answer “ yes” and a glow of light came from his head toward my heel. I felt it warm a brief. The pain ended, and I never felt it again. I did go get the spur removed as normal but never felt any pain to mention from it from that day on. A little on jokes with me all the time in the spirit realm which I see in both realms, gifted I suppose. He says he is from God sent to watch over me.  I think angels come in different forms. I believe I saw God even in person the same way. Once as an old man and another time as a big greenish grayish blackish supernatural being I think. Maybe even in flesh somewhere in space. He projects himself having instant Daffodils and honey bees, dipped in olive oil or with white wine sprinkled over the flowers as one of his favorite things to eat. Said he had only revealed himself to three men that in any way of the sort.  They were Rafael on a boat, Moses and then me the as the third, if you count me twice. Then it’s four. I lived in Israel 2000 yrs. ago. I w! as told by 3 psycic people that I was Messiah. I am supposed to reveal myself 2012. God hasn’t affirmed it. I just know Antichrist will rise and you won’t be able to put money in a drink machine and get it to work. God will give him that kind of power as best I have seen it. Then after brutalizing me as a young man and losing my friends and family, finally come looking for my resolve of his rein. Kill him and war it out before he gets more powerful. 40 days of war has been prophecied. I pray for you all. The number will be in telepathic form sent out for all who will receive. Your answer in your heart and mind already you see. Like a bad acid trip. Spirit romping it all down for the devils last stand.",

Just after the count down to the New Year, my friend and I noticed a bright red sphere moving unusually across the black sky.  The red sphere moved sideways, up and down, and back and forth; unlike a plane or satellite.  When it came to a stop above us in the sky, we thought for sure it was a UFO. My friend took photos of it on my camera, but he didn't zoom in or take actual moving video, which discouraged me later.  The red sphere made no noise or sound whatsoever.  It looked like it was parked to view the fireworks going off in the West San Fernando Valley.  It looked like it had large round \"windows\" around the orb itself. \n \nThe first photo shows the red sphere moving, and the other photos show it still in the sky.  After a few minutes, it either disappeared or its lights simply went out.  I am not surprised it disappeared, because a bunch of people were standing around with us in the backyard pointing at it yelling, \"Look! A UFO!\".",

    "text": "Three orange orbs over Eastgate Ohio \n \nAt precisely midnight on January first two thousand twelve my youngest son was having an asthma attack  In his room on the uppermost level of our tri-level home.  My wife and I  were in the lower most level watching TV.  My wife promptly ran upstairs to administer his treatment. As she was doing so something caught her eye through the bedroom window. She called for me urgently to come upstairs.  Thinking something was wrong with my son.  I quickly ran upstairs only to find him standing in the living room where his mother had told him to stay.  The front door was left wide open with my wife calling for me to come outside. I ran outside to find three brilliantly glowing orange spheres peacefully gliding just above the street in front of our home.  I would say they were no more than fifty feet above the tops of the neighborhood homes traveling almost directly out of the south heading north very slowly, no more than five miles an hour, between five and ten feet appart from each other, and completely level with one another on the horizon. They were moving so slow.  My wife and I were able to get a good long look at them.  We both quickly tried to dismiss them as some kind of new year lanterns, but their color was so vibrantly warm and completely uniform.  There was absolutely no deviation in their luminosity, no flickering as if the light were to come from candles.  They did not rise in the air whatsoever as if to be a hot air balloon.  They didn't rise rapidly as to be filled with helium or any other lighter-than-air gas. Their were no signs of rockets attached to them.  They were not filled with LED lights, the light almost appeared solid, uniform.  We watched them drift, but with absolutely no wind behind them, in fact no wind at all.  They also made no noise, no mechanical sounds;engines, rotors etc.  Walking back through my home I went out the back door and continued to follow them glide over a neighbors home about two plots away.   As I watched, the last most southern orb began to what I could only describe as short out and slowly fade out of existence.  The other two remained to slowly venture north never changing in eleva! tion.  I watched them until they could no longer be seen above the horizon. Just after our encounter with these orbs my wife and I recalled the strange yet completely peaceful silence we both experienced while we were watching them.  Though we live just outside a commercial area in the suburbs we heard no cars, no celebration of the new year wich later seemed very strange. \n \nIt was a profound moment but not our first either.

This was something I witnessed as a young child and there are things I simply cannot remember.  I was approximately five years old at the time this event took place.

My account is  mundane, but it is the true. \n \n My father was in the US Navy, stationed in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  My parents were visiting friends who lived near a playground.  Across the street from the playground was an empty beach.  My older brother and I went to the playground along with the children of my parent’s friends.  We had only been there a short while when we witnessed a silver saucer shaped craft either fall or land in the ocean.  I don’t recall details of the actual descent; but it didn’t make much of a splash.  It just bobbed in the water.  No one emerged from the craft.   \n \n\"I think we’d better go in now,\" my brother said.   We went inside and did not mention what we’d seen to our parents until years later.   \n \nAt the time of the sighting I was not afraid, though my brother seemed apprehensive.

They also didn't dissipate or lose altitude, as is common with fireworks, flares, chaff, or skydivers with lights. \n \nThe second witness with me thought that the lights were only about one hundred feet in the air, or slightly above the tree top level.

    "text": "Port Charlotte Florida large procession of lights in various colors moves slowly in a loose, linear formation. \n \nThe night sky was clear.  First sighted heading west – began as a triangle formation of three white “star” sized lights moving very slowly.  Next we noticed some lights were following behind the triangle.  Formation began to change to a somewhat wide cluster, dispersing the triangle shape of three lights at the front of the movement of lights and appearing as if they were all just part of a tight constellation of stars, almost imobile but still some small movement westward.  Anyone looking up at this time may have thought it was just a concentrated area of stars and thought nothing of it for the several seconds or minute it was formed this way.  The lights (at least 20, probably more) then began moving, still very slowly but more noticeably, and forming a narrower line formation which then curved strongly to head north-northwest.  They seemed to be flickering now in different colors occasionally as green, blue, red, and white, but mostly white, as they passed almo! st directly above us.  Sometimes an occasional brighter flaring of color would come from one of the lights; and sometimes they were no more than an average star brightness in white.  The catepillar-like loose, linear formation of lights continued north-northwest until they became too far away and 'dim' to continue to track.  There was no sound; no aircraft sounds.  The entire sighting lasted about 10 to 15 minutes.  We called our neighbors over to view – 3 adults and one minor child.  Upon first sight of the “constellation-like” scattering formation, our neighbor thought it was just that, a cluster of stars, until he realized they were moving, and continued to watch the procession of lights changing formation and moving in the sky above us.

At about 12:15 amon Jan 1st, I glanced out mysouth-facing bedroom window to see 2 round orange balls about a foot apart in a straight perpendicular line. I could not figure out what I was looking at....perhaps some reflection of the streetlights? As I moved to look better, they appeared smaller but still in same formation.  I thought maybe they were large orange planets in the sky in a formation and came to ask my son-in-law if any planets/stars were sposed to be in alignment that night, New Years Eve.  He and my daughter then came to see and as we watched, these orange balls of light became smaller and smaller very quickly as they seemed to move away and eventually they seemed to come together and disappear.

    "text": "Red/Orange fireballs over Louisville, KY, USA on New Year's 2012 \n \nRight after midnight on New Years Eve, I witnessed strange lights in the sky near Shenanigans Pub (Corner of Norris and Deerwood) in Louisville. Several other patrons saw the lights and I was able to snap a few photos (attached) and my friend was able to record some video. The lights were orange glowing balls and travelled generally south to north and appeared to be powered. Ambient noise from the bar was loud so I couldn't hear if the lights made any noise. They travelled one after another along the same path at erratic intervals, although usually around twenty or thirty seconds apart. They travelled in a straight flight path and that path generally drifted and changed to the northwest as the event took place. They were below the cloud cover, but one did go through the lowest clouds. I estimate I saw around twenty and that the whole event lasted 10 or 20 minutes. To recap, they travelled at approximately the same altitude and along the same path. \n \nThey glowed a dark orange and didn’t seem to flash. When viewing them through my camera phone they seemed to flash at a constant rate. \n \nMy friend who also witnessed the event is a pilot and called Standiford Field air traffic control (Louisville International Airport) and they said they had nothing flying in the area. Both of us called the police and the dispatcher said we were the only people to call it in. And we called a local news station tip line who told us we were the only callers to report the event. I also emailed all four local news stations with the facts and photos on January 1st and received no response. \n \nFinally, in one of the photos some non-glowing spots are visible. I’m didn’t see those during the event so I’m not sure if they are due to reflections or some other camera error, or if they are related to the event.",

A pair of binoculars was used to view the lights.  While we were unsure of the exact shape of the objects, we agreed the general shape and size was around 50 feet long and seemed to be triangular but because of the glow we could not be sure.   \n \nAT 1:20 I called a friend who lived across town and asked them to go outside to look for the objects and he also confirmed our s! ightings.

    "text": "It was a snowy night and a round reddish white oject appeared towards our hotel room. \n \nHi Peter, I'm bored at the office today as things are a little slow and stumbled upon my \"ufo pics\".  Anyway, I thought I would send them out to several people to see if anyone could be of any help.  I just wish I could zoom in with today's technology I'm sure someone might be able to see some detail with these. \n \nAny how yes I'm saying that this is what I shot for a photo and I believe to be a UFO.  I would fill out your form but I want to be taken seriously and not ((deleted)).  I can’t believe what I saw and I will give you all my info here from my email.  If you really need my info then I will do it. \n \nThis is how it went.  January 1, 2010 my wife and I, and 2 of my good friends rented a room in New Hampshire at the Loon Mountain Ski club on the second floor of the building.   We had a balcony off our room over looking the Kangamangus Highway.  It was New Year’s night at about 10:00 pm.  I was out on my balcony by myself at first and when I saw this object of a bright whitish some what red color it was round in shape. I slammed on the glass slider to my wife and friends to grab a camera.  They came out so fast I almost went over the balcony.  My wife had the video camera and my friend ((female name deleted)) had the still camera.   \n \nFrom there the object slowly came from over the mountain top towards our hotel.  It gracefully made a left hand turn towards Rt. 93 which is a major highway.  It did take about a minute or 2 before it was off in the distance and it seemed to appear and reappear.  Then it was gone.   \n \nWe went back into our room and I was anxious to see what we had photos and vid! eo of.  It’s amazing that what was taken as a photo and what was on the video and what we saw are all three different object especially when you zoom in.  I was so worked up my eyes watered and I became tingly and numb.   \n \nWe got so intrigued that we started looking up info about sightings in that area.  We found several occurring on that highway around the same days but different years.  Put it this way, as I right this almost 2 years later it still makes my head go tingly and numb.   \n \nWell as for the sound it was 10 pm and it was cloudy and snowing out.  You know how it gets when its snowing you can here a pin drop.  We didn't hear a thing and believe me it was close enough that you would hear at least something.  \n \nIt was too cloudy for a hot air balloon and 10 at night.  It wasn't a flare because it went for miles.  My uncle is a pilot locally here on the cape and I have been around small planes and helicopter my whole life.  I mean what in the hell flies when it’s snowing and! you can see the ceiling of clouds flying over head.   \n \nThis has no explanation.",

    "text": "Diamond Shaped UFO Blocks USAF Runway  This is a second hand story. \n \nMy brother, who still wishes to remain anonymous, was a USAF sergeant and air traffic controller of the Strategic Air Command from approximately 1958-1963 when this event occurred. \n \nI do not know what time of the year it was but suspect December 1962-February 1963. He worked in the tower at night at a very busy SAC Air Base during the height of the Cold War.  I believe that the base may have been Maelstrom as he lived with his family in Helena, Montana, and may have been home to a fighter wing, MATS wing and perhaps a refueling wing.  I think that their primary SAC aircraft were B52's. \n \nIn a moment when we were alone in 1986, upon my questioning about UFO's and his time in the USAF, he related this story:   He said that at night while awaiting the return of a flight of nuclear-armed (They always were then) SAC bombers a diamond-shaped group of flashing colored lights, semi-solid, settled into a hover just some feet off of the threshold of the primary landing runway as a squadron of returning bombers approached making landings impossible.   \n \nWhile the bombers were rerouted, the security force \"surrounded\" the object with their armored vehicles and men, training their weapons on it but maintaining hold-fire discipline.  He described the object as \"big as a house\".  I do not recall the length of the event but believe it was an hour or more.  Apparently the Air Police could not stop spectators from appearing from all corners of the base.  The base was completely off-line and all work halted except of course by the Security Force.   \n \nMy brother was privy to all internal radio communication from his position in the tower.   \n \nAfter the object departed (I do not recall his description of that if he gave it.), their aircraft were called back from their havens and the base made an attempt to achieve normalcy.  Evidently they had difficulty in this, as within a few days my brother, a sergeant with a good record,  was dismissed from the highly regarded Strategic Air Command and given only days to pack up his family and leave for his new assignment with Training Command (He taught an entire generation of USAF and Army air controllers.), where his career languished for ten years.   His only \"crime\" seems to have been being a witness to this event.  He said that many others received the same treatment and that he never saw anyone from that base again and believed that was the USAF's intention.   \n \nHe further stated that his marriage broke up as a result of this transfer and some further USAF harassment that he did not specify.  He felt that to some degree, perhaps intentionally, the Air Force intentionally encouraged the dissolution of his marriage. \n \nHe returned to the active Air Force ten years later, still a controller this time in the Tactical Air Command and finished his 30 year career as a Master Sergeant.  He then worked perhaps fifteen years as a contract controller at the NASA base (Elington Field or Elington AFB) in Houston.  He is clearly a quality witness to this event and is highly regarded in his field as demonstrated by both his USAF career and length of time employed at Elington Field (NASA) and though now fully retired he will not discuss this matter further. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

At approximately 7:30 pm I was on my way home driving east making a right hand turn south and noticed a bright red light in the sky my girlfriend, 7 YO god daughter who were also in the front seat of the car saw the red light too (approx. 40 to 45 degrees from horizon looking south) my 49 YO friend and my girlfriends 9 YO niece who were in the back seat also saw the light. I told my girlfriend the light was a planet either Venus or Mars most likely mars because the light was red. She agreed it was a planet because the light was not blinking and the light was larger then all the stars. Anyways, I was excited because I had binoculars in my car and wanted to take a closure look at what I thought was a planet. So I pulled into the driveway got out of the car with my binoculars and the object was gone? We were all baffled, but my girlfriend said “no look its right there”, when I saw the light we realized it was at a different p! osition in the sky, approx. 30 degrees from horizon, I focused on the object through the binoculars and noticed it wasn’t a star or planet. The object was a red sphere split horizontally with a single very bright white light moving right to left (at the split) the object was stationary for maybe ten seconds then the object began to move almost vertical (5 degrees right to left) from 30 degrees to 45 degrees (this took about four  seconds), at the 45 degree position from horizon the object stopped and appeared to move away from us in the direction we were looking at it until the object completely vanished (approx. 8 sec. at the 45 degree position). Anyways we all went inside the house talking about what we had just saw, less than a minute later I decide to go back outside and take another look, and there in the same area just above the tree line, the same object appeared, my girlfriend, god daughter and I looked at the object through the binoculars and the object went throug! h the same maneuver as described above. I have gone back outsi! de to se arch for the object with no luck. I did call local police to report what I saw, and the said to call Pasco WA airport tower and make a report because the Walla Walla airport tower was not opened. Anyway, I am guessing that the object was approximately 15 to 20 miles away from the point where I saw it. The size of the object from where we saw it was about the size of a dime at 25 feet away. Well I just wanted to tell others what we all saw and attempt to describe the sighting to the best of my ability. \n \n Regards,",

It did not seem like a firework, plane or helicopter . It was silent. Can't really say how high it was, but It didn't seem as high as a jet.  I jumped up and walked out to the street to follow its track, but it was soon obscured by trees.  Im not sure if my memory is correct, but I think it was red on the edges and orange toward the center. Hope someone else saw it.",

    "text": "Brilliant flickering orange sphere flies over, then hovers and then shoots straight up punching hole through clouds. \n \nThis incident occurred as I was taking out the garbage cans to the street edge at 10:45pm Sunday night. \n \nThe weather had a slight fog, with a thin layer of clouds covering approximately 50% of the sky. \n \nI saw what I initially thought was an aircraft approach from the east at an altitude of approximately 1000-1500ft.  As this object approached closer to my position, I noticed it was giving off a brilliant orange color and had a spherical shape. It had no navigation or running lights (I am a former private pilot) It moved probably no faster than 60mph in my estimation. \n \nThis object radiated the most brilliant and pure color of orange I have ever seen.  It flickered as it moved, as a road flare flickers when burning. The object emitted no noise whatsoever. It was quite obviously spherical, with no projections anywhere. \n \nIt made a slow arching turn from its initial flight path right toward where I was standing, slowed and then stopped almost nearly directly above me (staying at ~1500ft altitude).  The object hovered for no more than a few seconds.  Suddenly, this object flew straight up punching a hole directly through the cloud layer (est. 2000 ft) above it.  It flew to an altitude to where it was a pinpoint in less than 2 seconds. \n \nNotes/Impressions:  - Aircraft flight patterns in my area are generally from the the South to North (To/from SeaTac airport)  - This \"object\" I witnessed came from the east (from over Tacoma proper) which is unusual in my area unless it is a military aircraft from McChord AFB  - There was a few aircraft flying in the area at the time of this incident.  I would say there is a good chance a pilot flying in the area saw this object. \n \n - Other people in my area at the time must have seen it.  The glow was quite brilliant. \n \n - I got the impression it \"knew\" I was looking at it. \n \n - The color of orange this thing emitted was extremely \"pure\" like coherent light from a laser - ie. the pure red or green you see from a laser. Not like an aircraft navigation light. \n \n - The faster it moved the more it seemed to \"flicker\"  - I am aircraft/military buff and can recognize most civilian and military aircraft.  I have never seen an object like this one. It flew outside the performance envelope of any aircraft I have known about.",

    "text": "2 dark stealthy orbs silently cruised above Houston while rotating around each other \n \nHello, Its 3 am and I haven’t been able to sleep because of the thing I saw.  I would not be wasting my time filing a report on this if I weren’t sure of what I experienced earlier.  It was strange and weird, and  I just want to let someone know.  I’m in total shock, its too ridiculous and bizarre! This occurred at Houston , Texas,  around 11 pm.   \n \nAfter driving my girlfriend home, and coming back home, I started to look up at the beautiful clear sky. The sky  here in Houston is never clear and you definitely never see so many stars as they were tonight. The beautiful  clear night sky and stars hypnotize my attention for a few seconds . That’s when I saw this/ these object (s). It seemed around 100 or so feet above the sky and it came the north heading south, it cruised over my head and in open space so I got a real great look at it! It seemed like two metallic or dark stealth looking orbs, its pretty crazy because the orbs did not give any light.  The way I saw them was from their shape and a sort of reflection that reflected of the surface of the objects. The objects seemed around 20 -30 feet in diameter and were 20  feet apart in a parallel horizontal way. I at first mistook the objects for a single plane who I thought did not have the lights on (I thought the orbs we! re giant light bulbs on the edge of the wing or something) but I notice the orbs were separated as starts could be seen trough the 20 foot gap between them. That’s when I was like woah, what could that be? I also did not hear any noise, complete silence , which kind of creeped me out. As the objects cruised away , I saw them rotate around each other in a circular pattern.  When I saw that I totally lost it and decided to look down. Thanks for hearing me out, had to tell someone.",

At first I thought it was a star or planet such a Venus or something, however, I noticed it slowly moving in the South East direction. The first light to catch my attention was brighter than Venus on a clear evening. It was following another dimmer light. There were no sounds from them and they appeared to be far off in the distance. I watched them make their way across the night sky. Both objects moving in the same direction keeping the same amount of distance between them. The faded as the reached the horizon line. I live near an airport and I'm used to seeing objects in the sky, however, these two objects acted differently. I wouldn't have thought anything of it if there hadn't been two of them. The first one I saw dimmed quicker than the one leading the two lights. I've never seen aircraft do this, they have flight patterns and generally there are no flights out of our a! irport this late.

It maneuvered much like a helicopter.  It had the directional lights on it, as well as a strobe light.  It was circling above the City of Pittsburgh, though higher than the buildings.  I couldn't see any body of the helicopter.  At one point, all of the lights turned off but one.  It looked much like a star in the sky.  Then all of a sudden, it turned into a VERY bright light that was painful to stare at.  It then proceeded to turn back on it's directional lights and strobe light. \n \nJust a few short miles up river on the Allegheny, I saw a similar craft.  It could have been the same, but would have had to move at a lightning speed.  It did the exact same thing with the lights as the first craft. \n \nI live fairly close to an airport.  I have seen planes and helicopters at night before.  I have seen them from all different angles and making many turns.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen before.

The lights were big, round, very bright, and seemed to be move around eachother at one point. The light on the right went out, almost like someone turned of a light switch, and then the second light  went out. Immediately after the lights  disappeared i noticed a bunch of smaller blinking   lights surrounding the area where i had seen the lights. We live in a secluded area and are surrounded by federal land. There is a military training base about 35 minutes away. We have a lot of air traffic, military and non military, so I'm assuming we live in some kind of fly zone. \n \nThis was not an airplane.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.

    "text": "Very large circular object moving VERY slowly with orange lights covering the whole of the ship \n \nI was at my job walking out to the trailer yard to smoke a cigarette. I work in an industrial park and the area I was in was cleared of trees and obstructions.  I looked toward the south and there was a circular object moving VERY slowly right above the treeline.  The oval object had orange circular lights going around the whole of the ship and I stood there crossing out everything that it could be in my mind. It was most definetly NOT a balloon or a cloud or a plane or a helicopter. It was moving so slow that a plane has to be crossed out and if it was some stealth kind of military plane the shape was all wrong. It was NOT sleek or strong looking. Actually it looked sort of huge and clunky. It looked like something out of like a 50’s sci fi movie and not some newfound classic CGI spaceship that adorn our movie screens today. I knew that the ship was soon going to descend out of my sight beyond the treeline so I yelled at one of my coworkers who was approximat! ely 50 feet away. As I ran over to her the object just reached a point where it could not be seen anymore. I asked her, “Did you see that UFO?” and she said, “Is that what it was? I saw it and I don’t know WHAT that was…” The object if I had to estimate was very large I would say half a football field in length (150 feet) and I was appox. 150 feet away when I saw it. I witnessed the craft for about 15 seconds. It was dusk and I think that actually helped in assuring me it was a UFO and not something else. If it had been completely dark I would have probably chalked it up to something natural because then I could have ONLY seen the lights. Although it was too dark to accurately identify the color of the ship I could at least see the outline and it was in my opinion not of this world. As a side note, my job is one exit off the highway away from Fort Meade. We are literally yards away from this military base and approx. 20 minutes north of Washingon, DC.",

I drove to get a closer look, even though I could see them through the trees because its winter and with no leaves on the trees. The color was what stood out, and the brightness and color being amber. It is an overcast night tonight in out area but these lights in amber were very clear. \n \nUpon getting to see them better I knew I only had my iPhone 4 to try and get a photo of at least the formation. They were apart from each other in formation, but upon looking directly at the objects I noticed they were not blinking, and there color amber was a stand out.  They also hovered, no forward or backward movement but I tried to take a photo even though it probably wouldn't show, and the phone was in auto and the flash went off. I switched to video quickly and filmed but they were  not going to show up on a cell phone.  As soon as I took the photo by flash one of the colored objects moved covering the other object, then one broke apart and it disappeared, and the other followed.  The thing about this is they just vanished as if a hole was in the night's sky for they to go through.  It also looked a little like an ember burning on last blow out at a fireplace, but the rapid disappearance was very intriguing.  The night's sky sucked them up.",

    "text": "3 Disc like crafts sighted on the eve of 2013 in Brisbane area Australia. \n \nHi, I live in Capalaba Qld in Australia. Me and my wife had a couple of friends around to celebrate New Year's Eve with us. Shortly after 10pm we ran out of coke so me and my friend decided to walk to the BP service station which is just behind our house. \n \nAs we made our way we observed 2 orange lights steadily moving from the direction of Victoria point towards the back of our house. I am unsure if the light was actual light of the moon light reflecting on the surface of the crafts. They did not flash or make any noise (but did seem to shimmer slightly) and maintained the same distance from each other constantly. As they moved out of sight one of the lights faded away. When we returned my wife and My friends partner told us they had seen them too but observed 3 lights instead of 2. We didn't know what to think and left it at that. \n \nBut, shortly after midnight, about 12:04 we saw the lights again, 3 of them in a triangular formation coming from the same direction.  Again they moved so silently and softly maintaining the same distance from each other.  We were facing towards Victoria point with a clear sky and the moon bright and up to our left.  It was when these objects moved underneath the moon that we were convinced that they were alien crafts.  The light from the moon cast down on top of them revealing three huge disc shaped crafts with what appeared to be a hard metallic surface.  It was hard to tell how high they were but they seemed quite low. Possibly the height a news chopper would fly at. \n \nI can say with up most certainty that they were not planes or helicopters, hot air balloons, weather balloons or any other man made craft. I have seen all of these things numerous times throughout my life and they look nothing like what we saw that night. \n \nFeel free to ask me any questions that you may have about our sighting. \n \nKind Regards",

    "text": "one huge UFO or three seperate ones \n \nOn or about January first of 2010 I was out after midnight on my ranch in Maricopa Arizona to get something from my truck.  As I looked to my left which is West in a saddle of these small mountains about a one mile and a half away I see these very bright lights.  As I watched them there was no noise at all and it was very quiet out that night.  These lights were in a pattern of three like a triangle. There were three separate UFO’s all in a straight row for a total of nine lights.  They were moving very slow over the saddle of the mountain.  My first thought was man that is some big mining equipment being moved at night.  But then I realized there was no sound which you would hear because it was that close.  The lights were very bright I mean like football stadium lights and they were lighting up everything out there under it from about sixty feet off the ground.  You could see cactus and rocks really clear too just like a bright sunny day. It was so dark out there ! that I could not see any sides or edges to what ever it was.  I watched it until it had gone over the other side of the saddle. \n \nI was perplexed as to what I had just seen. I thought I had seen three separate UFO’s flying together in formation.  But later after telling my wife what I had just seen. She said “well, how do you know it was three separate ones, maybe it was just one big UFO!’. Now that really got me thinking. That craft would have been huge.  I mean this saddle area it flew through is about the size of one to two football fields wide.  I heard you on the radio one night and got your web site.

I didnt make any noise. \n \n After that I saw 1 around may. I biked home and when I was home I walked up the stairs and saw this orange/red ball of light again.

    "text": "One single, beach ball sized .... \"red ball\" \n \nBack in the beginning of 1987, a buddy of mine and I, had gotten off work at local movie theater. \n \nOur shift ended at 11:00pm and since neither of us had eaten that day, we decided to go to a Jack In The Box, grab something to eat and then go for a ride in my old car. We left the theater in Hayward, Ca. somewhere around 11:10pm and drove 20 minutes or so to the Jack In The Box on Castro Valley Blvd. in Castro Valley, Ca..   \n \nAfter leaving the drive-thru, we headed east on Castro Valley Blvd. and eventually came to Paloverde Rd., where we made a right turn. \n \nNow, It's dark out there and there was always a rumor or two, floating around our high schools, that the Palomares Rd. area was haunted or something, as was Niles Canyon Rd. To tell the truth, we did go there to eat what we just bought, but also, we went to look for anything unusual, which we soon found. After making my right turn on Paloverde Rd., I spotted, just up ahead, the entrance to Palomares Rd., so pulled over to the right hand shoulder of the small road and parked, right where Palomares Rd. met Paloverde Rd; it was a lonely spot. \n \nJust across from where we were parked, stood an old abandoned barn, with some old advertisements still painted across the back end of it, facing Paloverde Rd. \n \nWe started eating and within a few minutes, sometime around 12:00 am, a red ball, about the size of a large beach ball, came up Palomares Rd., heading north, entered on to Paloverde Rd. and stopped directly infront of my car and spun around in circles, in mid air.  It made no noise at all and it was a solid red color.  It didnt't flicker or shoot sparks or anything like that and again, it was about the size of a beach ball.  The whole thing happened only a few seconds from start to finish; approximately 7 or 8 seconds at most, at which time it sped away, heading east up Paloverde Rd. towards Hwy 580 and out of sight. \n \n We both saw it and have always talked about it whenever we run into each other. I should mention though, this was NOT the first time that I and others that I was around, had witnessed this same \"red ball\".  One \"red ball\" flew through some trees one warm evening, back in the 80's, and zipped right through our Dodge Ball game, about eight of us kids witnessed it, this was in Hayward, Ca.  The other time, I was sitting on top of my dads 1964 Chevy, thinking about some girl in class or something, when I saw a large \"red ball,\" high up in the sky.  It was following a DC-10 or somekind of large, jet passenger plane.  It circled around it and flew from one side of the plane to the other; as if it were playing with it. I ran inside the house, to tell my parents about what I was seeing outside, when I spotted the nightly news on tv.  The news person was mentioning that a large, \"red ball\" had been reported that evening, following and zipping around a large passenger plane and it was being called a \"UFO,\" by whoever judges those situations. \n \nThis was also in Hayward, Ca. \n \nI have no reason to lie.  These events were real, all three happened at night, and all three events were witnessed by other people. \n \nThanks. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Please take the time to read my entire story as it gets quite interesting.  What I am writing is not for my personal satisfaction of pulling anyone's leg.  I do not like telling this story because not even my family would believe nor would the families of the other three witnesses believe them, as well as it was a chilling event.  I didn't report this for years simply because it had not crossed my mind however I am very interested in the unknown and believe in extraterrestrial existence.  I swear to this story being absolutely true as i payed attention to the details as it happened.  This, I imagine, is a very rare report. \n \nThree friends and I were driving through a very rural area in north east texas.  It was very late at night, probably 0330 as we were coming back from a party in a neighboring town.  None of us were hallucinating or in an abnormal state of mind.  We were listening to 99.5 the wolf, a country music station.  With no prompting, the data on the screen of the car's \"head unit\" changed to slashes and the audio coming out of the speakers changed...The following is the best way I can describe what came out of the speakers.  It was as if it was a recording of an interview with an astronaut.  The music stopped following by a very short pause then, what started playing was an older man (i would guess by voice) talking about being on a NASA mission outside of our earth's atmosphere.  During the said mission, the man recalled definately encountered what he referred to as alien aircraft (not UFOs) and that he and the others in his vessel could clearly see \"them\" out the window dogmatically.   \n \nThis story the man was telling \"played\" for 5+ min.   \n \nAs this was happening my three friends and I were silent at first, blankly looking at each other.  I was sitting in the back seat and wanted to make sure the two in the front were not playing a joke on me.  I leaned in the front seat and could see the Ipod in the car was clearly not plugged in nor was any other music or internet device.  Then my friend that was driving the car (the owner) pushed the power button on the \"head unit\" firm enough that it should have shut off and absolutely nothing happened.  Then he proceeded to turn the volume knob multiple turns in each direction and the volume did not change either. He repeated both power and volume actions again and still nothing happened.  The volume was still playing at a loud enough level we could clearly hear the details.   \n \nWe sat in awe for the approximate five to near ten minutes that this was \"playing\" over o! ur radio in the car.  Nothing was around us as we were on a ro! ad surro unded by cut corn fields.  Suddenly the interruption stopped and was followed by the same one or two second pause that stopped the music and then the music started playing again (different song obviously as 5+ min. had passed.)  \n \nThe three friends in the car with me were not sketchy friends for I had known them for approximately ten years and still know them all.  We have talked about the incident since and all have the exact same memory of the event.

Since there were no open public bathrooms around, we decided to go by a field off the side of the road. \n \nWhile urinating, i was staring at the sky when i noticed 3 glowing orange orbs in the sky.  I kept staring for a few seconds and noticed that they were moving about while staying in a triangle formation. The lead orb moved slighty farther ahead and than would slow for the others to 'catch up' as it seemed. \n \nAfter noticing what i was seeing, i pulled out my phone and took a 2 minute video which captured the orbs moving from one side of the horizon to the other (east - west) withing the 2 minutes.

As I approached the rear of the main  building on my way back from the dumpster I happened to glance up over the top of the building and I saw at an altitude of approx.  two hundred feet two glowing red spheres, a bit darker shade of red where the main mass was in the center of these spheres, the sphere to my left appeared to be a little further back but at approx. the same alt. as the one on my right I stood and watched them for several mins. trying to determine what these objects were.  I thought they might be marine style flares but there was no visible residue falling nor any smoke.  There was no visible movement in alt. or in x-y axis.  There was no audible noise from these spheres and the nearby roadway was also quiet.

    "text": "I observed the following by eye & through binoculars. \n \nWhilst watching the New Years Fireworks from my 2nd story which affords me a good southerly view I noticed two orange lights flying in sync along the southern horizon. \n \nI know what aircraft look like as my home is in a flight path for PDX airport. \n \nMy interest was piqued as the lights differed from the planes that I see as they were not red or white but orange.  First the two objects were flying east to west in a formation which seemed quite strange i.e one of the lights was low on the horizon and behind the other light that was higher up from the horizon, plus they seemed to be flying at a fast speed, not zipping across the sky at an unfeasible speed but faster than planes tend to go . \n \nAnother brighter, whiter light that I took to be a plane flying along the normal South to North air route for Portland International airport was flying to the West of the orange lights and didn't garner my attention until it started to fade out,  I don't know how but it was there then started to diminish and was gone.  At this time the lower light was no longer there (I don't know how it went it just wasn't there anymore) whilst the other kept along the east west path it was on and too faded out of my view. \n \nThen I saw another light that seemed similar to the two previous orange lights much lower on the horizon, for about 20 seconds which then dropped away from my view beyond the horizon. \n \nShortly after this a plane one with the white and flashing lights came into view and flew an arc westward over towards Portland City Center.  This gave me the impression that the other lights I saw were quite a ways off and going much faster than this plane. \n \nI viewed the orange lights through my binoculars and did not see the red and white flashing lights that planes normally have.  It may be that they were aircraft that did not exhibit the normal night time lights, but these had no flashing lights on them, were in a formation and seemed to be moving fast. \n \nI wanted to put this up as I am intrigued to see if any other folks saw this or have an opinion on what I saw. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

    "text": "3 Orange/red balls seen by police officer \n \nAt approximately 0010 hours on 1/1/2013, I was on patrol (police officer) attempting to avoid the fireworks going off in my town (New Years Eve parties). I decided to drive to the far north end of town and observed what I thought were three (3) planes flying unusually close and moving faster than normal in an east bound direction.  The objects were flying single file behind one another with approximately 500 to 1000 yards behind one another.  I would describe the objects as pulsing orange and red (more red) and from my distance would appear circular.  However due to distance, an actual shape could not be conclusively determined. \n \nMy first impression was that these planes were flying way to close for FAA regulations and were moving faster than normal. It is important to note that these objects were due north of a medium sized airport.  It is also important to note that I have lived right under a major airport highway for a major city airport and my town is in a direct path way (most of the time) to this airport mentioned above.  I state this simply because I have a lot of experience watching planes take of and land.  I am also very aware of normal lights on planes.  I am also aware of covert lighting, dim/ no lighting procedures. \n \nI would guess that if a plane normal plane is moving at 500-600 miles per hour at this altitude (10-15,000 ft?), these objects were moving under super sonic speed but pretty close.  It is a cloudy night tonight and these objects could be seen for some distance to the east.  By the time they flew over me and I was able to get my binoculars out of my trunk, they were gone.  That was fast.  It took me approximately two minutes to dig for them. \n \nFinally, the only other comments I could state is that they were not blinking lights on the wings of a plane.  The object would have been totally engulfed by what ever this red/orange object was.  It was moving too fast to be commercial aircraft, which would have been in that particular area.  I am not aware of any further witnesses, but people driving home may have seen me point my spot light at the last object for a brief moment.  This seemed to slow it down for a second. It then flew at the high rate of speed, out of sight.",

At first it appeared to be three lights, two orange with a white one in the middle.  As the lights moved very slowly across the sky, they coalesced into one orange light. \n \nMy one son and I saw this one.  I moved to the window and watched it.  I told him it was a helicopter, but I knew that it wasn’t.  When it got across the street, the light went out.  Whatever it was, it did not fly-off or anything, it just disappeared. \n \nI didn’t really think that much about it until we saw the second one follow the same trajectory.  This time we opened the windows and listened for the sound.  I called my other two kids into the room to see it as well.  There was no sound.  None at all. \n \nAs we were standing there, three of them came up on the horizon in approximately the same location.  They flew in a triangular formation along the same path.  Halfway across the sky, the light in the rear, flew off at a rapid pace 90 degrees from the original path.  This one flew away from the house, as opposed to the other two that were flying along the back side of the house.  I got my binoculars out, and thankfully, the city lights illuminated the sky as a backdrop.  I was able to see the formation of something ahead of the orange light.  It appeared to be some type of triangular shape, but I couldn’t see it any clearer than that.   \n \nI followed it across the street, and again the light went off, but I could still see the shape of the thing moving across the sky.  My binoculars are not very powerful, but I watched it as long as I could.  It continued in the same direction until I could no longer see it. \n \nA sixth one did the same thing a few minutes later.  I have no idea what they were, but they were not helicopters nor were they airplanes.  They looked like nothing that I have ever seen before. \n \nAbout fifteen minutes later, there was a series of about three helicopters circling the area.  I do not know if they were related. \n \nWhen I first saw it, I thought that the orange light was the afterburner of a jet.  The object was moving too slowly to have been a jet with an afterburner, and when I got a closer look with my binoculars, I could tell that the orange was some kind of light.

As soon as the clouds had covered half my view of the night sky I saw a UFO moving very slowly from west to east and hovered above me about 10 000 feet as though it was observing the electrical storm. I had a good look at it with my binoculars and noticed it was triangular shaped and had light of a orange colour emanating from what looked like widows of a rectangular shape.

The strange thing was:  On the 5 of January 2013 I was watching TV and through my living room window I saw the same UFO coming from the NORTH, this time it was closer but on the same course and exactly the same time 12:22 am, I then had a better view with the binoculars and noticed that it wasn’t one ball of orange and red light but a disc shaped craft with four lights equally spaced under the craft( orange/red orbs) without the binoculars it looked like one big orb of light.",

At first my mother thought they could have been a firework that had just exploded and the lit up particles were falling to the ground.  But they continued to stay in the sky.  We pulled over to watch the lights for about a minute or so.  They were not really moving too fast.  We got back on the road and arrived at her apartment about a minute later.  I looked up in the sky and there was only one light.  I came back out after eating and there were no lights to be found. \n \nI have checked the local newspapers and searched the internet to see if anyone else might have seen and/or reported these lights.  So far nothing can be found.  We were not the only people driving around last night who could have possibly seen this occurrence.  My husband and brother also saw the lights in the sky and wondered what in the world they were.  I’m a skeptic on these kinds of things.  But I just can’t get over what I witnessed last night.  Hopefully with this post maybe someone else can help identify what it was or possibly witnessed it too.",

    "text": "Fiery yellow-orange ball in clear sky, hanging at 8:00 to Jupiter; it floated and drifted , then flamed out, but sphere remained \n \nI am a 64 Yo Master’s level Professional Woman, socially responsible and not considered a kook of any kind. Although this was on New Year’s Eve night, I had nothing to drink or substance of any kind. \n \nI was at my significant other’s house for the evening and decided to go home about 1:25 AM. I traveled about 3 mis north, then turned west on to 74 St South. Immediately, as soon as I was facing due west I saw a very bright orange light directly in front of me. It was moving very slowly in an erratic pattern appearing to move north, then drift in an easy turn to the east (toward me), then to the south, then straight up, almost straight above. I would say it was about a 1200 feet up and almost a mile or so away when I first saw it. I was so amazed and so entranced with the phenomenon, I called my friend to tell her to go outside, she did not answer. I called her several more times hoping she was would see it, too. \n \nI could not continue to drive and watch, so I pulled over to stare with curiosity and a bit of trepidation. When I first saw it, I thought it was a helicopter, but within seconds realized it was too big, too bright and moving to erratic for a helicopter. \n \nAfter I parked I knew immediately it was not a helicopter or plane.  At that same second the intensity of the color got brighter and more yellow-orange.  It was sitting in the sky at about 8:00 to Jupiter, just kind of hanging around, like it was a fiery balloon floating in the wind.  It was not so large that it could have been easily covered in the sky by my thumb.  As it started to climb straight up, the fire of it flickered more intensely, but the flame itself started to die out and soon it was extinguished. However, the “object” was still visible:  it was not round, but I could see it was spherical.  It did not emit much light, but yet, I could see that it was there, lighter gray than the sky and still doing the same lazy floating pattern of drifting.  I decided I needed to get out of the street where I was stopped and go home to watch it from my back yard, which was only about 5 mins away. \n \nI lost the object then.  It was gone by the time I got home. There were more clouds, then, as if they just appeared out of nowhere; where it had been was not clear any longer.  Jupiter was there as was some duller stars, but no object. \n \nThe object was very consistent with a fiery ball, although it did not sent out sparks or trail any flames or vapors, it was like watching a flame wax and wane, change color and intensity, get brighter, then snuff out.  By the time I got home, I was so alert and hyper-vigilant that I am not sure I will be able to sleep for several hours yet.",

I live in Eastern Orange County, Fl, approx 12 miles east of the Orlando Intl Airport (OIA) in a rural type area.  The objects appeared in a somewhat vertical line but were staggered behind each other at different altitudes and fairly low on the horizon.  It appeared as if the objects were floating or traveling slowly to the north.  These objects appeared to be lower than the air traffic in the area that was departing from OIA.   \n \nThe air traffic appeared to be initially departing to the south and then turning crosswind to the east and then turning toward a north departure from the Orlando area.  It was very apparent that the orange glowing objects were not aircraft.  I watched the objects for approx 1 min and the ran into the house to get my wife and son.  Upon returning to the front yard, we saw 3 remaining orange glowing objects in the sky.  Apparently the other! 2 or 3 objects had disappeared.

You suggested I complete an Event Description form. \n \nAt 21:27 on January 1st, 2013, I witnessed two objects approximately 60 yards south of me heading in a northern direction at approximately 40 feet in the air and traveling at 20-25 mph over a heavily populated residential area.  At first they both seemed to be triangle in shape, but as they flew over me they seemed to morph into globs of bright yellow, orange, reddish and very bright white.   \n \nAs I watched them fly over me there was absolutely no sound or prop wash.  At about 100 yards past me the first one accelerated at an incredible speed as did the second one a few seconds later. \n \nAs an Ex-Air Force personnel I am familiar with Military Aircraft (SR71’s, Stealth Fighters and numerous other aircraft) and maneuverability of such aircraft.

These “fireballs” at first were thought to be helicopters, then planes. They did not make any type of audible noise, no lights that flashed, or any other type of identifying marker.   \n \nThese “fireball” craft orange in color would fly coming from the SE heading NW below the cloud cover, how-ever the first one and the last one of these seven would head North.  These aircraft would fly in their respective directions then disappear out of sight.

    "text": "5 Reddish Amber Lights Moving Multiple Directions Then Disappear. \n \nWe were all sitting in the back yard when there was a very bright reddish amber colored light that immediately drew our attention just over the tree line.  This even was at about 11:57pm and we watched it just until the ball dropped.  We all went inside to watch the ball drop and celebrate.   \n \nWe then grabbed the small firecrackers we bought for the kids to see and went out front to the roadway to set them off.  At this point the light was gone.  We were all very confused as to what it was being that it moved in multiple directions then hovered just before we went inside.  After lighting the firecrackers and rounding up the kids to go back inside we saw the light appear much further off in the distance in the complete opposite direction.  Myself and one of the other adults stopped and watched it as it moved east, then north, then hover and disappear again.  About 20 seconds later it reappeared much further away, much too fast for any craft I as a civilian know of.  It then hovered once again for about 20 seconds, flew north west, hovered again for about 10 seconds, then continued northwest.  Slightly after it hovered the last time, another appeared and began to fly towards the original.  As the second sighting got closer to the first, the first completely vanished.  The second hovered and sure enough a third began its ascent towards the second.  The second flew to about where the first vanished and hovered as the third started to move closer.  At this time a fourth came into sight flying towards them both.  The second sighting vanished and a fifth and final appeared and performed a very similar routine until all 5 vanished at roughly the same location in the sky.  We watched for a good 20 minutes afterwards to see if perhaps they would return, they never did.  All 5 sightings were very bright, reddish amber colored, moved in random speeds and direction, made no sound whatsoever, and all vanished at about the same location in the sky. \n \nDoes anyone else have a good explanation for this?

I looked towards The Clockum Area and there were 4 Amber colored lights in the sky all at different heights in the sky.  I noticed one begin to move upwards and the one next to it followed.  I called to my two friends to look at what I was seeing.  They saw the same thing.   We watched as these 4 lights moved up and down several hundred feet at a time. 2 of the lights would be moving while the other two held still.  After watching for a minute I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look at what we were seeing.   \n \nWhat I saw still is difficult for me to describe.  This craft seemed to have more than one level, at least 2. It was pulsating and there's was so much going on with the lights inside this large object.  The object was orange/Amber in color.  One object appeared to have a globe shape on the top.  I handed the binoculars to my friend and asked her what she saw.  She couldn't speak for bit. She too couldn't believe what she was seeing, and was having difficulty explaining it. \n \n After seeing the first two thru the binoculars, I went to look at the other two lights and they were gone.  My friend saw it shoot straight up into the sky while I was looking at the others.   The 2 remaining lights were still hovering and moving around in the sky, traveling what appeared to be several miles at a time in any one direction, but stayed over the Clockum area, but they too then disappeared straight up into the sky. \n \nThis event lasted for 3.5 minutes. It began approximately 15 seconds after midnight, and lasted until 12:04am January 1, 2014.   These were extremely large objects, and they were like nothing I have ever seen before. \n \nThis is not the first UFO's the 3 of us have seen and reported.

At this point my mother in law was actually frightened and went inside I mean all! of us were blown away and there is no doubt what we saw that ! night ai rplanes?! NO helicopters? NO! miltary flares? NO! shooting stars?  NO weather balloons?  NO!  NOTHING we have could just stop in mid air while maintaining altitude perfectly and just vanish!  Even still, over cities every aircraft i believe is required to have a strobe which these did not.  The way they moved, looked, felt, just.. yea we saw UFOs no doubt in any of our minds! Well thank you guys and i hope this story helps for future reference my eyes are glued on the sky and i will be prepared with a camera next time!",

    "text": "Multiple bright orange orbs glowing in the sky and shedding droplets of light \n \nIt was at midnight on New Year’s Day when I noticed the unidentified flying objects hovering the cloudless northern skies.  At first I began to think that the unknown objects were part of a firework display exhibited by the local residents.  Then upon focusing into the night sky, I quickly realized this was no firework display at all. \n \nThe object began to fade in the sky about 45 degrees from the horizon from a tiny spectacle to a round, dark orange/amber glowing shape which magnified about three times its original size.  Once this object achieved its optimal size, it then flew south for approximately 15 seconds at an incredible speed and then decelerated.  The next segment is what caught my attention the most.  Once the object stopped from its propulsion like movement, it stood stationary glowing brighter and brighter in the sky with a strong hue of orange dominating its presence.   After standing still for about a minute, it then (in my best description) shed some droplets of light descending directly beneath from the original object at a distance not measurable with the naked eye.  This image reminded me of heating a metal to its melting point and then observing its free falling behavior as it was poured out of a ladle.  The object would then fade away into the darkened universe as if it traveled out of! our galaxy and onto the next.   This particular occasion occurred several times over the next 35 minutes and at one moment in time, there were as much as three “UFOs” in the sky simultaneously.",

A UFO landed in my driveway and the pilot got out and asked for several wooden boxes of uranium.

    "text": "Six yellow-orange lights with reddish halos moving from NE to SW at midnight on New Year's Eve spaced about 45 seconds apart; no sounds \n \nMy wife and I went out on our deck about a half minute past midnight on New Year's Eve to watch some neighbors' fireworks.  As I lookup up I saw a fairly bright yellow-orange light with a reddish halo around it moving silently from the NE to the SW.   \n \nMy wife also saw it.  We could not determine how high up it was as the sky was clear and there was no frame of reference.  It did not seem to be a plane or helicopter as the light did not blink and there was no sound.  It moved moderately fast covering perhaps a 45 degree arc of sky in about a minute. \n \n As we watched, a second light came into view over our roofline from the same direction and on the same route as the first.  It was about 45 seconds behind the first.  Watching the first light, it dimmed as it got further from us, then was not seen.  Changing to watch the second, a third light appeared, same time interval, same path.  This occurred six time; six lights.  Several of them seemed to change their course slightly to the south as they moved away.  Because of our roofline, I was not able to observe where any of them originated. \n \nI thought perhaps the lights were some kind of flares suspended from balloons - but they moved too identically for that in my opinion.  Another thought was some type of crafts watching the firework displays for New Years.  However, there were very few fireworks seen; our deck has a good view over the city.  The only other thing I could think of was some kind of night maneuver with our local national guard unit - but I don't think our small unit has six helicopters.  I have read some other observations of similar light sightings over the past months.",

The flames were clear to see.  The whole object was a glow.  The flames were going up, the flames were not training behind.

    "text": "Red and Green lights above Goose Creek, South Carolina, New Years Morning! \n \nNeighbors were setting off fireworks in celebration of New Years so my wife and I went to the front porch to watch.  We noticed this green/red light in the sky to the east. It looked to be two green lights side by side with a red light that pulsated slowly.  I set up an 8MP camera on a tripod and started recording.  Sometimes it appeared that the green lights were on top with the red at the bottom and sometimes this orientation changed - but the changes were very slow and difficult to notice with the naked eye.  Occasionally, the light would slowly drift to the south and then back to the north, returning approximately to its previous position.  After 8 minutes of recording, the green light turned off leaving only what appeared to be a pair of red lights and the light appeared to slowly descend until it was obscured by the tree line and out of sight.   \n \n20 – 30 seconds later, my wife noticed a red light of similar intensity moving north, but it was obscured by trees and other houses so we could only see little bits until it was out of sight completely. The recording is blurry – as they always are – it’s difficult to focus at an object in the night sky through such a tiny viewfinder.  The object appeared too steady to be a helicopter or any toy I’m familiar with.  There was a light breeze, so I think that would have caused a balloon to move.  No sounds from the object were detectable by me or my wife. I checked today – there are no towers or tall buildings in that direction, just 4 miles of residential neighborhoods and then wilderness for a hundred or so miles after that.   \n \nJust a really fun thing to see on New Years! \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

All the land to the south is tree-covered, sparsely inhabited hills.   \n \nIt was 32 degrees out and it had rained in the morning so there was a high, light fog/haze in the night sky where if I looked towards the horizon, the haze looked whiter and thicker than when I looked up, but even though the sky was much blacker straight overhead, no stars were visible. \n \n \tSome fireworks were still going off but there were no nearby Roman candles or star-bursts showing up above the treetops. Then as I stood there looking around, a bright, solid red light came into view from behind a hilltop coming from the South, horizontal to the ground, just under the fog level.  \n \nAt first I thought it was an incoming airliner, as under certain weather conditions, airliners often approach the Spokane International Airport by making a low circle around this end of the valley to make their approach.  And, the craft was traveling about the same speed as an incoming jetliner and at the same altitude.   \n \nBut, as the craft came nearer, I realized the red light was too big and bright to be on a jetliner and there was no green light on the other side of the \"plane\" nor any white lights on.  The size and brightness of the red light would have to have been the equivalent of every light on the bottom of a jetliner being changed to red lights all on at the same time, creating the impression of one large light.   \n \nI could not see any shape to the craft and the size of the light seemed to encompass the entire bottom of the craft as I could not see any bigger extension of the ship outside the circumference of the light.  What I was seeing definitely was not a \"fireball\" or other \"natural\" phenomenon - it was a huge red light on the underside of a flying craft. \n \n\tJust as I was trying to figure out what kind of craft it was as it got closer, another identical red light appeared from behind the hill right behind the first light, and then a third red light approached at the same interval as the second one was to the first one.   \n \nNow all three bright red lights were strung out just under the fog, equidistant apart, flying at a relatively slow, steady speed and coming straight towards me.  By now I knew these were not regular airliners and also, there was no engine sounds.  Then another two red lights appeared together, much closer to each other and behind the first three. \n \n\tBy the time the pair of red lights appeared, the first craft seemed to stop right at the edge of the forested property, as if he didn't want to venture into the illuminated populated part of the valley.  The point at which the craft stopped was about 3/4's mile from where I stood.  This first craft started fading from view into the haze right above where he had stopped his approach.   \n \nFrom what I saw, he had flown in under the fog horizontal to the ground, reached a certain point beyond which he was not going to travel and instantly switched to rising straight up into the sky, at a 90 degrees angle from where he previously had been traveling.   \n \nThen the second craft did the same thing at the same exact location, and then the third craft, too, as if they had reached an invisible wall.  I got brief glimpses of the red lights as they faded into the fog, so it wasn't as though the craft just disappeared. \n \n\tAs the first three ships ascended into the fog, more identical craft were appearing at the same altitude and speed from behind the hill in the same close-knit but random fashion until I counted 21 craft in all.  And, as each reached the \"invisible wall\", it rose into the fog the same way the first craft had done.   \n \nAfter the last ship of this group faded upward into the fog, I waited a few minutes more to see if something else was going to appear.  When nothing more happened, I ventured down the front sidewalk towards the street to get a better view of the night sky and saw a single identical \"red light\" craft due West a couple of miles away but still at the same altitude.  I watched it for a few minutes, but I could't tell if he was moving at all, or if towards me or away from me.   \n \nNo other craft appeared around him and I couldn't tell if he was one of the original 21 ships I had seen or if he was ship # 22.  The whole episode lasted about 10 minutes and since I was getting quite cold, I went indoors even though the craft in the West was still visible.   This was my very first UFO sighting and until I saw your word choices for \"Shape of Craft\", the word that came to my mind was a \"squadron\" of craft. \n \n\tI am in my mid-60's, retired from a lifetime of being self-employed in small business with my husband, married for 42 years and a college graduate.   \n \nI was halfway through typing up this report to you when I turned on Wednesday's Coast to Coast and heard your January 1st report to George Noory about all the red lights and fireballs people were reporting.  I have listened to Coast to Coast for over 25 years, and still remember Art Bell's first broadcast of \"Mel's Hole\".   \n \nThanks for the work you and Coast to Coast do to monitor and let us know what is really going on in our world.   \n \nMy hat's off to you.   \n \nHappy New Year!",

I have never seen anything like this in my life.  My father and I were both startled by what we saw.  I then decided to call and report what I had seen. I was very surprised to hear that there had been a flood of calls reporting nearly the exact same thing that I had seen all over the U.S. and Canada.  What I found very strange was the precision with which they traveled.  The three lights, or objects, maintained an exact distance from each other as they traveled.  They had to have been controlled. It was very strange.  There was no sound coming from them either.  I tried to get video of the objects, but was only able to record a 2 second clip of them on my cell phone.

A car had just skidded off the road into the side of my neighbor's house not far away.  It was New Year’s Eve and we listened to people in the area setting off fireworks, but none were visible from my street.  We were watching the antics with the police and tow truck for a while. \n \nAt about 12:15 AM, my friend pointed out a bright orb that had just appeared in the sky to the west.  The light cast off of the object was far more intense than any airplanes or helicopters we've ever seen in the skies, so we caught it all on our phones' video cameras. The light from the object had a much deeper amber-red hue to it, which really caught our attention. It traveled a long, curved path and passed overhead.  The object then ascended vertically at a higher speed, until it was it was out of sight completely. \n \nAbout 5 minutes later I spotted a second object (matching the description of the first) suddenly appear in the sky, as if it materialized out of thin air.  It eventually flew straight up into the sky like the first, until it could no longer be seen.  A few minutes later a third one had appeared, hovered, ascended, and went out of sight.  All three objects were slow moving, until they changed courses up to the sky and sped up significantly.  We didn't know what to make of the whole scene in the sky, and we would have filed a report sooner if we had the first clue how to go about doing so.  At least we got some videos of them!  It was cool to see!  \n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ43c0x-gyI http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKrQiA8yaa4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz5kyXIwr9U",

My impression was that they were no more than a mile or less away from me.  At first I couldn't tell if they were moving. As I proceeded I did perceive they were moving slowly, not in tandem but the same general direction.  They didn't seem to be joined.  They move towards the southwest, almost paralleling my route.  NO other lights or “navigational lights” were seen.  After about 2 minutes the light farthest west of me disappeared.  Followed by the second one at approximately the same point in the sky a minute later.  I could not determine if they just turned off the lights or flew above the cloud layer or just disappeared. VERY weird. \n \nAs I continued driving I couldn't stop thinking about what I had just seen.  A minute or so later I had the urge to look at the same spot where I had first seen them to see if there would be more and much to my shock there were EIGHT more strung out over I would guess a distance between a half to one mile long.  There was no type of \"formation\" to them, just scattered across the sky.  All exactly the same color and intensity as the prior two.  They followed the same movement as the first two.  Again they didn't seem to be joined together in any way. I watched them as I continued driving for the next 2-3 min.  I finally got so frustrated that I had pay attention to driving I simply stopped the car in the road got out in the light rain to watch them unimpeded.  I watched for another 2-3 min.  Again my impression, based on the low cloud cover, was they couldn't have been more that a mile away from me.  Probably placing the one closest to me no more that a half a mile maybe less.  I could hear NO sound coming from them.  I even cupped my hands behind my ears for at least a minute to try and determine if they were engine driven. NO sound.  They then began to “disappear” one at a time just as the prior two had.  WIERD. \n \nAt this point I was exhilarated and could wait to get home and tell my wife. I was very disappointed that I was so close to home but could make it there to rouse my wife to see them in time.  Well one more time as I turned down my street I looked back to the same spot and once again I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, there in the sky were two more.  Same as the last 10. I raced inside to get my wife up to see them.  She WASN'T happy.  Until she looked out the bedroom window to see them.  We watched them for a couple of minutes till they followed the others to the southwest and finally “disappeared”.  Made no sense to her either.  Now she can't say I'm crazy.",

The quality isn’t very good, but you can see the fireballs floating and pulsating.  They seemed to be floating up into the air over the mountains one by one.  Then they just vanished into thin air like the last time, one by one the top one going first.  The only difference between this sighting and our earlier sighting is that there were only 3 UFO’s this time, and also they did not go into a perfect straight line, but they were lined up vertically.",

    "text": "Orange ball stationary in sky above neighborhood south of Fort Worth before leaving northbound \n \nWhile driving northbound out of the Carson Ranch estates, north of Crowley and south of Fort Worth TX, my daughter and I observed an orange light or “thing” floating completely motionless above the neighborhood at an altitude of what I perceived to be between 50 and 100 ft.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere. The sky was clear. \n \nAt first we thought it was some kind of flaring firework because people had been setting off fireworks in the area as the New Year began 45 minutes prior.  We were baffled that this “firework” was suspended motionless in the air as we were driving past it.  It was more baffling that, upon further observation, the light appeared to be an illuminated, orange ball hovering in the sky.  It did not appear perfectly round like a sphere; but, rather, it looked more ecliptic or egg shaped. \n \n The object was to the right, or east, of us by a perceived 200 or 300 meters away.  After looking at it for about 15 or 20 seconds as we were driving by, the object suddenly started moving!  It travelled northward.  Neither my daughter nor I heard any noise emanating from it. \n \nWith my curiosity peaked, I proceeded to “chase” the object and turned eastbound as it continued northbound, east of us.  The object appeared to start accelerating and gaining altitude as I drove under its path of flight.  At this point, I got my phone camera rolling. I turned northbound at the next street.  However, the object was now going too fast to catch up while driving down residential roads.  I stopped my car and continued filming for a few more seconds until it was too far and faint for the camera to pick up anymore.  However, I could still see it with my eyes as it changed its heading from north to northeast.  I could tell that it changed course by using a street light as a reference point. \n \nAs the object was moving, its illumination had a slow, subtle pulse to it in about 2 or 3 second intervals, from bright to dim then bright again, repeatedly.  The pulsing was very subtle and not immediately obvious. \n \nThis was NO Chinese lantern!  It had started moving from its initial stationary position much too quickly. It was not windy; 5 mph at the most.  This also had too much range and speed to be a remote controlled helicopter.  If it was a drone or UAV, why would it be illuminated orange as a whole?  And why so low?  I am very curious as to what this object could have been.",

We had just dropped her off at home and stopped at a store to pick up some champagne to go home and celebrate.  Being New Year’s Eve I feel it is incredibly important to stress that we were sober and hadn’t had anything to drink, not even a sip.   While at a stop light, I looked out my husband’s window, he was driving, and saw these three strange orange lights high in the sky.  I asked my husband if he thought they were airplanes or helicopters but their behaviors were unlike any helicopter of plane we had seen. \n \nThe three orange lights were grouped together but as we watched they spread out and formed a triangle.  My husband told me to take out my phone and record what was happening but I was too shocked and in awe of what we were witnessing.  The triangle of lights then moved as if they were going to align in a straight line pointing down.  Our stop light turned green so I urged my husband to pull into a parking lot.  As we were pulling into the parking lot, two of the lights just disappeared.  The remaining light flickered a couple times, maybe twice before disappearing.

We saw a single light, looked like a fireball and we thought it was an aircraft with bright lights as the weather was a bit foggy.  About one minute later we saw another “light” closely following the first.  We went outside onto our porch as this seemed strange as aircrafts do not follow that closely and suprisingly there were no sounds as a low flying aircraft would make.  Then we saw another light following the 2nd.  There were therefore, three of these “fireball” type lights travelling in a horizontal motion. \n \nThen, the 1st light slowed down and descended toward the ocean or probably some other direction and faded.  The other two continued on, maintained a distance within each other and did the same.  By the time we got our camera out, it was gone.  It is 1.18 am and the fog has cleared at least by 50% and we are now wondering if these unidentified flying objects, “fireballs”, were using the fog as a cover whilst travelling.

I had walked up to the top of my street (which is approximately a 32° angle uphill), and turned the corner walking to the right and past the first house on the right.  My dog then stopped to use the bathroom in the grass, while I stood there looking north, staring off into the dark between the large clearing of two houses.  (This would be looking in the direction as if I were at the top of my street looking down).  I saw what looked at first to be just airplane lights, red and blue, out of the corner of my eye.  Didn't think much, until I realized these lights were moving usually fast.  So I turned my attention directly on them, and within a few seconds, saw the lights stop and hover, and then all of a sudden they made a complete \"sideways U-turn\" and started headed east.  I literally said out loud, \"What ((deleted)) is that??!!\" (talking to my dog).  Just as quickly, the lights swerved back to the left (west), and flew for just a second until it stopped and hovered again! I proceeded to get my phone camera out to videotape, and as soon as I pulled the video application up, the red light in the sky went out, leaving just this fluorescent blue light, which suddenly dropped straight down, quick as lightning! Like it just fell from the sky.  I focused my camera on where I thought the light had dropped, and caught it on camera shooting straight back up..  it then dropped down once more, which I saw with my eyes, but did NOT catch on camera (even though my camera was focused right on it) and between messing with my phone, I did not see the light come back up.  About a minute later I saw both red and blue lights in the sky again, seeming to fly north until they just disappeared suddenly.  It was the strangest, scariest, yet most exciting experience I've ever seen…  I didn't even think it was real.  I asked my dog, \"Did that really just happen!?\"  It happened so quick, I literally almost doubted myself.  But there is no doubt about what I saw.  There was definitely SOMETHING there, and it was NOT NORMAL, and NOT an optical illusion...  I cannot explain it to be anything other than a UFO.",

Something caught my eye as flying toward me below the horizon of the hill. Being after dark, I first thought it was an unusually large bird with white tipped wings, but they began to glide north and moved above the horizon, one object began moving ahead and bit faster than the other. With the light of the horizon I began to get my depth of field and could see the two objects were moving north at an extremely fast rate of speed. They continued to remain between my location and the hills, so their distance was less than two miles away.  Their altitude continued to be much lower than the ceiling for the airplanes in the area. I have never seen a UFO before and there was no possible way these were airplanes or anything of earthly origin. They were not very large, but they were! not extremely small like the orbs occasionally described either. They were moving extremely smoothly and at a rate of speed even as they began to increase altitude, as if there was no resistance and the moved far faster than any aircraft we have and making no sound at all. Being so close, there should have been some sound. The movement was much more like gliding, only at an extremely high rate of speed. Just after the forward craft began to distance its self slightly from the craft in the rear, they both accelerated and disappeared heading north.  The light omitted from these craft was constant and white with no blinking or other coloration.  The craft themselves was dark or shadowy, and impossible to make out.  The lights were dimmer than I would have guessed from descriptions that I have heard of UFO sightings in the past and even compared to other aircraft in the area that were much higher and further away.  Due to the flight path of planes moving south from Los Angeles, th! ere were several airplanes in the area, although none in the direct pa th north, south or west of the craft.  The sighting lasted roughly 20-40 seconds.  I doubt very seriously that I was the only one to see these.",

    "text": "Four orange-red lights over Pittsburgh, PA dropping smaller orange lights. \n \nOn New Years Day, 1-1-14 at about 7:30pm EST, I stepped out onto my front porch.  I live about 5 miles north of downtown Pittsburgh, PA.  I just happened to look up at the sky (there were no stars this night) and saw two orange-red lights slowly moving through the sky side by side.  I thought it was a plane at first.  The two lights then separated from each other and slowly moved apart and then stopped completely and just hovered in the air.  Then, two more orange-red lights appeared right in the area of the original two.  There were now four orange-red lights hovering in the air, not moving at all and all were approximately the same size but, one of the original two lights was the biggest of all four.  Three of the four lights began disappearing and reappearing in roughly the same spot over the next 5 to 10 minutes.  During this time I used my compass on my IPhone and found that the objects were in the southeast sky (I also got some of the lights on video b! ut, it is a bit grainy).  The entire time these objects were disappearing and reappearing, one of the lights, the biggest one of the four, remained illuminated and appeared to slowly grow in size.  Then the large steady orange-red light began dropping smaller orangish balls of light from it.  It dropped about three smaller orange colored lights, which would travel straight down and then disappear after 2 or 3 seconds.  After this occurred, all four of the lights illuminated and moved slowly north, with three of them disappearing again.  The large steady orange-red light traveled out of direction with the other three and headed almost exactly in the direction I was standing at in front of my house.  When it began getting close enough where I could see the object really growing in size and see that there was more to the object than just the orange light, it disappeared.  This same light then reappeared about 30 seconds later, dropped one more orange colored light from it and ! completely disappeared. \n \nI watched this area of the sky for the next 20 minutes and may have briefly seen an orange light but, nothing like what I first witnessed.  I did see several helicopters in this area in the next 20 minutes but, I am not sure if the two are related.",

    "text": "Over Boston, 4 bright orange lights approach separately, hover, then recede to the South East \n \nI live on the edge of Boston  Common and was walking my  dog at 7:45pm on Jan 1. I walked onto the Common from the NW corner and immediately saw a bright orange light in the sky. At  first, through the trees, I thought it might be a planet and marked its position so I could check on it again when I got to open space. When I did, it had moved and was closer. Being near Logan Airport, I first thought plan or helicopter but there were no blinking lights and it receded to the South South East. At this time I was out on open ground and the first light was out of sight, I saw another single orange light approach from the SW (from my perspective, approaching from the left side of the Hancock tower). It approached at speed, hovered for a minute or two, and then receded to the SSE. At this point there were other people walking through the Common and also looking up, seeing the bright orange light and remarking at it. After the second light was out of sight a third fo! llowed the exact same trajectory in, hovered and receded to the SSE. I decided to go inside, proceeded to tell my wife about the lights and looked out the window to see if there was another out there and there was. I grabbed my binoculars and what I thought I could see was the bright orange light and 2/3rds of whitish eggish shape to the bottom.  This light, like the others, receded to the SSE. I periodically checked out the window the remainder of the evening and saw no other lights. \n \n A couple of other notes: While I was out on the Common, I saw 2 large jetliners take off from Logan and come relatively close to these lights. One of those two times, I thought it was dangerously close,  but it allowed to give a guess at the altitude of the lights, which I would say was between 1,000-2,000 feet.  Also, while I could clearly hear the sound that the jets taking off we're making, and a helicopter to the North, these lights made no sound that I could hear. While I am aware of Chinese Lanterns, these lights each approached at what I would call \"aircraft speeds\", hovered and receded at 90 degree angle from origin at a similar speed.",

All 4 of us were frightened.  Craft proceeded to travel at the same speed as our car (95-105 miles per hour) as driver's response was a futile attempt to \"outrun\" the craft (this lasted about 5-10 minutes).  It should be noted that other witnesses were present as another automobile actually passed our automobile at approximately 110 or more, miles per hour. \n \nDriver became exhausted and recognizing that he could not outrun the craft, and fearing an accident at this speed, driver decided to slow down and finally stopped the automobile on the side of Highway 80, hoping that the craft would continue in it's trajectory, and simply pass.  Driver got out of the car and watched as the craft continued and finally passed.   \n \nNote: The craft traveled approximately 100 feet off the ground over the terrain which increased and decreased in height according to the height of the terrain as if perfectly measuring a gravitational effect of the earths pull on the craft.  There was no sound effect from the craft, and in fact, from any other source. It was totally quiet. \n \nUpon arrival at our destination, this matter was called into the USAF dispatch and a complete report was made by all 4 witnesses.  There was never any followup by the USAF.  I still remember this event as if it was just yesterday.  The only detail that still troubles me is the fact that it took us 6 hours to make the trip that even at 65 miles per hour should not have exceeded 4 1/2 hours.  This means that driver estimates that we were missing about 1 1/2 hours of time as measured from Reno to Pleasanton, CA., as the trip took us over 6 hours total.

We could hear a lot of fireworks going off in our neighborhood ever since it got dark so we went to our back deck  (The Wando River is North West with Daniel Island behind it).   \n \nIt was about 5 minutes past midnight.  Our deck is on a march that feeds into the Wando River.  All of our neighbors have decks on the marsh and I would think that a lot of them were on them that night but I haven’t asked them if they saw anything. .   \n \nWe saw some fireworks that looked like they were coming from across the Wando from the Northeast.  We then just started looking at the sky (we have a wide view from the deck).  We both noticed the “orbs” at the same time.  They were sort of in a circle-ish grouping.  I mean not a perfect circle but floating like a group.  They were kind of bobbing around but they stayed together and they floated at the same altitude.  They were bright round orbs.  At first they looked just bright white but then they seemed to be blinking or pulsing yellowish-orange.  We both spotted them at the same time and said jokingly “aliens”.  But then we both thought it was from the fireworks and would disappear.  But they didn’t disappear.   \n \nThey seemed to be going west and seemed to be over the Wando River.  They floated off together and disappeared behind a cloud.  We tried to figure out what they were?  They were too low to be aircraft?  We thought maybe Boeing was testing some new kind of drone or something since there has been so much talk of drones and airspace below 500 feet?   \n \nMy husband and I spend a lot of time outside.  We have been sailing in many places where the view of the sky is awesome and clear.   We have seen falling stars, satellites, planes, etc.  But we have never seen these “orb” things.  I did report this to MUFON because that was what came up when I googled UFO reporting.  I read some of the other MUFON reports and thought it was weird that so many other people were seeing the same type of thing all over the country that night and some of their videos look a lot like what we saw.  I would just like to know what they were? Hope this is helpful \n  \nBest regards, \n \n((END ADDENDUM))",

Then moved at a constant speed, then came to a complete stop and vanished slowly into the heavens, out of my sight.  It did not share any qualities that an airplane exhibits.   \n \nAn airplane’s light flickers at a constant tempo and the movement is constant and CAN NOT come to a complete stop in the middle of the sky.   \n \nIf I had a compass I would say the UFO came to halt at a perfect North.  I did not have a compass so I am basing my observations on the stars’ and the sun’s movements.  Make of this experience whatever resonates with your vibrations.",

What made me notice it was the color - a bright, glowing aqua blue.  There was no wind or any breeze, yet it moved quickly across the sky, and in less than a minute it was overhead.  I had a tablet computer with me and by the time I snapped a picture of the mass, it was already past my house and heading east.  It was not the moon or city lights that caused the bright glow.  The glow was gone within two minutes. I've been looking for reports of Aurora Borealis sightings in southern Arizona, but so far none have come up.  I'm hoping that someone else in AZ saw this and got better pictures.  It resembled Aurora Borealis to some extent but had a misty, amorphous quality to it.  It moved away too quickly to be a solar flare, in my opinion.",

No lights, no sound emitted, no exhaust trail. \n \nSIZE:  From Venus-size to slightly larger as it approached. \n \nCOLOR:  Yellowish white. \n \nDATE:  1/10/2014  EVENT DESCRIPTION: While out walking, I looked around at the pre-dawn sky and notice 2 bright objects to the west at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  They were both equally bright in magnitude (the two brightest objects in the sky at the time) and almost parallel to each other in reference to the horizon line (Rocky Mountains, Wet Mountain Range).  I thought it peculiar that they were both so bright, thinking one to be Venus and one to be a planet.  I soon dismissed this notion as no other planet or star is comparable to Venus in magnitude. \n \nAfter about 5 minutes, I checked the sky again and found that the objet to the south had moved to the 10 o’clock position above the object to the north.  At this point, I stopped and watched the object move in an easterly direction and turn to a new heading of north by northeast at about 45 degrees above the horizon line near Pike’s Peak.  Wind was out of the north at 15 to 20 mph.  I watched until it was out of sight. \n \nThe object’s speed is hard to calculate.  The best way to descibe it is that it moved at a “leisurely” pace with no apparent variation in speed. \n \nElevation of object approximately 15 to 20,000 ft.  My position was about 6,500ft. \n \nThe other object remained motionless during this time and visual contact of it was lost while looking at the moving object as the sky brightened. \n \nI am going to find out where Venus was in the pre-dawn sky in an attempt to account for the second “stationary” object. \n \nI will attest to this event by oath or affidavit. \n \nThank you for this opportunity and I would like to let you know that your work is greatly appreciated.",

It had a presence that seemed unusual. My g/f said at the time \"it must be a NYE blimp\".  We did not get a picture.   \n \nI thought it might just be a blimp too, but it wasn't moving. It was stationary, but kind of hovering like a blimp would, and gently pulsing.  It was much bigger than any star in the sky. We would estimate the size to be about 3x that of Jupiter- easily.   \n \nWe went back in after a couple minutes because it was cold.  Two weeks later when I read an article saying that multiple other witnesses had seen the same red/orange orb(s), I knew that what we'd seen was not a blimp, because throughout the southeast part of the stat! e (it was southeast in the sky) people had seen what I'd seen.   \n \nWe are both in our mid-30's, we enjoy star-gazing and we were not under the influence of drugs at the time.

I looked out of my window (south) and seen a very low flying object, about tree top high.  We are about 15 minuets from the airport in Springfield, IL, so my first instinct was that it was a plane, until it got closer.   \n \nI notified the passengers in the car to look out their windows on the opposite side of the vehicle as we came to a stop in the road and we all three watched out the windows.   \n \nAs it moved over the top of us, we realized that this object was triangular shaped and had lights on each point of the triangle and was not moving at a very fast speed for a normal plane.   \n \nAs we continued to watch, the object moved onward then turned into two seperate objects and took off extremely fast across the sky in two opposite directions.  One went northeast and one went west.   \n \nThis was not the first UFO sighting I have seen, the first happened around 1999 just north of Petersburg, IL, at approximately 9pm (3 witnesses), but this UFO started out as an abnormally bright light high in the sky, it disappeared then re-appeared within a few minuets but closer.  We shined a 2 mile flashlight towards the object and it disappeared again.   \n \nWe stared off into the sky in curiosity and suddenly, a large oval light, yellowish orange in color, appeared above our neighbors tree (approximately 1/2 football field away) it just hovered there without noise and another oval light appeared on the right side and one more on the left side of the first initial oval light.   \n \nThe objects stayed there for only a mere 1-2 minuets and then disappeared.

    "text": "4 red fireballs sighted near Snake River Canyon rim. \n \nAs I was headed home from work, I noticed a bright light in my front windshield in the upper right hand corner.  I pretty much paid no attention and figured it to be the usual aircraft with blinking lights.   \n \nAfter a moment I spotted another bright reddish light object below and to the left of the first one, just above the horizon, and continuing to follow the first object horizontally and then straight up into the sky.   \n \nI pulled the car over and observed them both for a few minutes.  The first one then accelerated a bit, and went straight up, thru, into and above the clouds..  I could see it all the way with light of the full moon above.  The second object followed the first one's course. \n \nI picked up my cellphone from the back seat, and tried to figure out who to call..shaking like a madman.  I then left the phone, went to the front of the car and 2 more objects appeared from behind a foreground hill-like mound, and they proceeded in a due line across, and just above, the horizon, from the  left to right.  At this time..with no luck.. I was pointing at the objects and trying to get vehicles passing to stop and observe. \n \nThe third object followed the other 2 into the clouds, and he last one I watched, as it slowed to a complete stop and dimmed. \n \nAll 4 of the red fireballs were moving on a Northeast to Northwest heading.  No sound, no smell; it was 17F degree according to my car gauge.  The night was clear and still below the cloud ceiling.  The objects were 1/10th to quarter mile away and were the size of a nickel held in hand at arm's length.  All of them were bright red/whitish in color with flame like streamers steamimg from the top and they had a revolving lighter red outer. \n \nI checked with the local TV  and newspaper media and no one else reported them,,as far as I know I am the only witness to the sighting.  I watched them for around 15 minutes.  This was on the old Jerome highway I mile west of the intersection where interstate 93 joins the old Jerome highway on the south side of road between there and the Snake River Canyon Rim.  Coincidentally, was just a few hundred yards south of the cell phone tower. \n \n \n((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) \n \nHello Mr Davenport, \n \nThe 4 objects were as large as a traffic control light when your stopped at it.  OR id say 10 times larger than Venus on a summer night. \n \nThis is my 5th UFO I've seen in my life.  We use to sleep out and watch with intentions to spot something.  I personally believe at times (THEY)  pick and choose who (THEY) want to see them...3 times if sighted something with wish of that.  I don't think this is coincidence,, somehow (THEY) know what your thinking? \n \nJust a thought. \n \nHave a great day \n \n((END ADDENDUM))",

    "text": "Three lights that looked like stars in perfect triangular formation, moving very slowly, then fading away simultaneously \n \nAfter parking in my driveway at around 7:30 PM on 1/10/15, when I stepped out onto the driveway I happened to look up at the stars.  It was extremely clear and very cold (around 15 degrees).  The stars were very bright.  I was looking to the southeast, and just below a familiar, sideways V-shaped formation of stars I saw three stars of equal brightness forming a perfect equilateral triangle.  They caught my eye and within a second or two I realized they were moving.  I had to stare very hard at them to be sure they were in fact moving because they were moving so slowly.   \n \nAs soon as I was certain of this, they began to fade away.  I would guess that between 5-10 seconds had elapsed when they began to fade out. It was like someone turned them off with a dimmer switch.  They just faded out perfectly synchronously and were gone in about two seconds.  I continued to stare at that area of the sky for about five minutes, but saw nothing else.  It all happened so fast, and my! eyes were still adjusting to looking at the dark of the sky, so I cannot say whether there was a form connecting the lights, though I did not see any stars within the triangular area encompassed by these three lights. They were the brightness of the average star until they faded.  Then there was nothing but the night sky.  I have no idea of any distance to whatever I saw. It could have been 100 feet from me, or miles away.  This is the first time I have ever been unable to easily verify something I have seen in the sky.  The lights weren’t blinking.  They were like the cold white light of starlight.  I see aircraft in the sky every night and they do not fade away, plus their lights blink and they usually have red and white lights. \n \nAs for my background, I am a Systems Programmer/Analyst.  I am 50 years old. I have a wife, 2 teenage children, 2 cats and 3 dogs.  The dogs force me to be out in my yard a lot at night, so I am always staring at the stars and planets when the sky is clear.",

Our dogs start barking defensively, which is not super odd, but then my boyfriend started shouting for me to come look at something. \n \nSo I was very scared right away.  An orange-red, fire-like, or glowing, orb came from the north over the tree line, and then over our house, and continued towards Lake Superior.   \n \nWe both could tell it was low in the sky because we had ran outside to watch.  He described it like he thought it was a drone, but it was too glowy, fast, and noise-less to be a drone, we agreed afterwards.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.   \n \nWe watched the thing as it got farther away and it stopped and slowly faded, but did not disappear.  It then started to blink green and red light.   \n \nAfter the shock of first seeing this thing come over us, we saw 2 other odd objects in the sky.  It was a very large triangle formation they had all made and all 3 were doing the same blinking.  One was way to the northeast; the one we saw flying was souteast, and a third almost directly east, but higher in the sky to make the tip of the triangle....  \n \nShortly after watching and then noticing the formation, a plane began approaching, and looked to be heading directly for it, but ended up below/south, but kept going past. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

    "text": "Went out to watch the fire works at midnight.  Saw the usual aerial fireworks but then saw 2 bright red lights traveling from the west and then turning in a wide arc to the south.  At first I thought they were fireworks gone awry and waited for them to explode.  Neither of them did.  That attracted my attention as being odd.  One was above the other.  After about 3 minutes first one then the other faded and disappeared several miles southward.   Went out an hour later (at 0:54) to have a smoke and saw a red light come from the west from the direction of Florence, Oregon followed by 6 others.  As they traveled in my direction, they all appeared to be moving very fast. They appeared to be traveling high above the oregon coast mountain range.  I have always watched the weather coming in from the coast ( we live 60 miles inland) and have a pretty good idea of what the weather is going to do here in the Willamette valley based on my observations of cloud activity wes! t of us.  I've seen a lot of jets in the area but none of them flies from that direction or that fast.  All of the red lights disappeared at the same point several miles toward the south.  All of them followed the exact same trajectory and faded quickly and disappeared at the same point in the sky. \n \nI have lived less than 2 miles from the Eugene airport for the past 23 years.  I have seen private airplanes, private jets, commercial jets, cargo jets, navy sub killer aircraft conducting touch and go training flights, and a wide variety of military jets taking off after re-fueling on north to south trajectories.  I know all of the trajectories for all of the aircraft that fly over or around my home and, at times, what time of day I can expect to see particular airlines.  I am can distinguish the difference between night time aircraft lights and landing lights between fixed wing and jet aircraft.  I also know the sound that all of them make.   \n \nTonight I neither heard nor saw anything I have ever experienced.  There were none of the usual stro! bing lig hts, throbbing engine sounds, or jet sounds.  I have also seen military jets climbing at night.  Their after burners have never looked red.

I capture at least 4 flying objects coming from the south and headed towards the mountains.  I got 2 pictures, and 3 videos on my tablet. \n \nThen I told my sister to go get her camera so she can record the flying objects. We stayed outside for a couple of minutes to capture them on video. Then we went inside our house. \n \nFinally, when everyone was asleep, at 3:26 a.m., I went outside to see if they were still there. They were, and still in the same position that we saw them.

    "text": "Orange ball of light/fire seen on North Coast; not Identified. \n \n\tAs is typical of the New Year's tradition, we went outside to light some fireworks and howl at the moon.  Plenty of others have joined us in this escapade, lighting a good portion of the street with fire while an occasional bottle rocket would flitter upward.   \n \nAs we look into the sky to gaze at a fireworks display, something catches my eye beyond the show.  \tA bright orange light shines in the distance.  It's brighter than Venus by comparison, glowing a dull yet vibrant orange.   \n \nFireworks dissipate over time while this unidentified light glimmers behind.  We stare in some mild form of disbelief.  Tears are coming out of my eyes for no particular reason I can fathom.  The light sits, unwavering. \n \n\tMy first thought was that it might be a paper lantern.  Being a holiday it seemed likely that someone might light off a few.  It's possible that a paper lantern could have been caught in an inversion current leaving it in a point of temporary stasis.  From experience we know what paper lanterns look like however, regardless of distance.  The light being emitted was far to bright to be a little ball of fire in a bag. \n \n\tAfter a few minutes the object begins to move away from us, getting smaller steadily.  I begin to run to tell my neighbors, looking over my shoulder every moment or so to make sure it's still there.  By the time I make it to my neighbors front door, the object has vanished.   \n \nWhile it's very plausible that this was something mundane, we can only go with the emotions during the event.  The feeling was grandiose, like witnessing a miracle.  Hearts were racing, not with fear, but a feeling of tranquility and unrequited joy.  Tears came down as there seemed to be no other way to express such a thought.  I simply remember thinking, \"We are not alone.",

My kid hurt his hand and yelled out, I turned to see if he was okay and was now facing north toward I-84, I looked at his hand and then he ran back into the house, with his father following him.   \n \nI did not follow because as I looked up, I saw some reddish orange orbs in the sky, maybe 50 feet up (just above the one story roof lines of our complex).  They appeared to be floating straight towards me, flickering like candles but synchronized.  I called my husband to come back out.   \n \nAt first, I was afraid they were some huge embers from NYE fireworks or something and was watching to see if they would burn out or land on our building.   \n \nBefore they reached our building, they took a  turn to the left (about 12 feet or so from me) though the turn was a right angle, the orbs floated smoothly, not particularly fast, just g! liding and flickering, more kept coming, spaced evenly apart and in some kind of formation, at the same height, spacing and rate.  They were almost floating lantern like but not that and way to small for that.  There were around 8 or so in all.  \n \nWe walked closer and watched them floating by and flickering, not sure what the heck they were, they moved out of our sight and we went back inside.   \n \nIt kept nagging at me, so I began to look to see if embers like these were even possible from fireworks (I could find nothing.)  I looked for fires or other reports of these orbs in the local news and saw none but then I stumbled upon a bunch of information online about others reporting floating orange orbs in the sky, all over the world.  (I've never heard of such a thing before.)  I came here to check out reports for Portland on new year's and found nothing, so I thought I should report it.   \n \nWe are stunned to find this may be UFO phenomena.",

    "text": "1-2 orange fireball objects in the sky \n \nAt 12:10 AM, I looked out the window to watch the local territorial New Year’s fireworks. The night sky was clear of haze or clouds, which is unusual for our area this time of year.  High in the sky (much higher than the city fireworks displays), I saw a bright orange round ‘fireball’.   \n \nThe object looked unusual to me, so I grabbed my 50x binoculars to get a closer look. Watching through the binoculars, I could see that the fireball was slowly moving from east to west.   \n \nAfter a few minutes, a commercial airplane flew from west to east, lower in the sky than the object, perhaps originating from SeaTac airport.  As the airplane neared the fireball vertically, the orange fireball light went out, but I could see the faint circular or oval shape of the object since I had been tracking it through the binoculars.   \n \nAfter a minute or two the outline became fainter and I lost visual track of the object even through my binoculars. \n \nThe orange object reappeared after a few minutes moving lower in the sky from west to east.  I had the other witness look through the window and by then we observed two orange objects moving from west to east.  We lost view of the objects as they past our local tree line after a few minutes. \n \nI have never seen this type of flying object. \n \n \n((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) \n \nHi Peter, \n \nWell, to tell the truth I am actually in Renton, but I put in a nearby Seattle area with a different zip code with a similar view in order to remain somewhat anonymous online. So you could use Bryn Mawr as the neighborhood online if you would like to be more specific. \n \nI was intrerested to see that you seem to have received quite a few orange fire ball type sightings from across the country.  Thanks for your reporting database. \n \n((END ADDENDUM)) \n \n \n(( ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) \n \nBTW, if you are trying to pinpoint a latitude and longitude, I would estimate the first orb to be over Tukwila or Kent, WA. \n \n((END ADDENDUM))",

It looked like something burning and on fire, which alarmed us at first.

The night was slient - no sounds of planes, helicopters, or the like.  In fact, there were no sounds at all - not even of other vehicles or animals - only silence and us quietly discussing what we thought it was we were seeing.   \n \nBecause we knew this was not an airplane or helicopter, I suggested taking photographs with my cell phone.  We took two photographs, one directly after the other (both logged at 10:14 p.m.); the changing shape of the object is evident in them.  It was bright orange in color, yet had a fog like haze around its perimeter.  I stated while viewing it that when really focusing on it with the naked eye, it appeared to be round in shape with a trail or \"spotlight\" appearing to be shining downwards.  Then, the object appeared to r! ise in altitude, the orange \"lights\" dimmed, brightened again very briefly and then it completely vanished leaving us feeling bewildered, curious, a tad bit nervous, but yet excited.   \n \nWhen it was all over with and we were discussing what we thought it was that we had seen and whether people would think we had lost our minds if we mentioned it, we heard cows mooing.  In fact, I made the statement, \"The cows are unhappy about something.\"  They continued to moo for at least an hour as if they were upset by something. \n \nPrior to releasing the photographs that we have, we would love to speak with an investigator.

    "text": "Two fireballs hovering over I-65  near the exit to the old Saturn Plant outside of columbia TN \n \nMy son and I had been hunting today on some family land in middle Tennessee.  On our way home on I-65 around the exit that leads to the old Saturn plant, we saw two lights in the sky.  I have an Aerospace degree and make a living in technology and design which puts me in some interesting experiences.  I am naturally visual spatial and am usually very aware of my surroundings and notice a lot of details.   \n \nWe drove for about 4 miles from the time that I first noticed the lights before finally stopping on the side of the interstate to watch them almost directly overhead.  At first the two lights were in close proximity to each other and seemed to rotate slowly at about a 20 degree angle from horizontal as we were initially driving along.  I say that it looked that way but of course from our vantage point in a moving vehicle it can look like rotation but not actually be that. the most interesting thing was what we saw when we came to a stop and rolled the windows down.  The two lights were at about 1000 feet altitude from our position.  We had an overcast sky with a ceiling of about 1200 to 1500 feet I guess without checking.   \n \nThese two objects seemed from my vantage point to be about as large as a car each in size judging from the size of the light they were emitting. initially from the first view we had of them, they seemed to alternate between brighter and darker in the intensity of their light which initially led me to believe that they were two airplanes that were in a holding pattern waiting for their turn at final approach into Nashville airport.  I knew that air traffic control would not have placed two planes this close together so I figured that they must be much farther apart yet my vantage point just makes them look closer.  I also thought they were much farther away than they actually were.   \n \nAs we pulled over and stopped the car, I could see that they were not airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, light from a ground source, etc.  We had about 30 seconds of clear visual from the time we stopped and tried to video to the time that the first object on the left phased out like turning off a light with a dimmer.   \n \nAbout 10 seconds later the second one on the right phased out the same way.  Now they did not fly into the clouds, they were below them.  The light they emitted was an orange glow like a torch.  I am familiar with most everything that flies and many FAA regs.  I also am able to use logic and reason to determine what I might be seeing.   \n \nAll I know is that with my experience both educationally, professionally, and Spiritually, I was not able to determine what I saw but I am convinced that it was not something man made.  \n \nI have never seen anything like it before and am very aware of what it takes to make something fly and these two things did not match that knowledge.  They did not emit any sound that we were able to single out from the mild interstate traffic.  We would have heard a helicopter or possibly even a drone in my estimation.  Even if it had been something like! a drone then from the size it was, we would still have seen the object against the cloud ceiling via the ambient light emitted from the nearby urban infrastructure when the light it emitted phased out.   \n \nAgain the light was a orange glow times two, fixed hovering in the sky about 1000 feet above the ground  with a constant fixed distance between the two.  The left one phased out first, then 5 to 10 seconds later, the second one phased out the same way leaving no trace or sound.   \n \nAgain, I reiterate, I would know if they were airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, flairs, ground emitted light, etc and they were none of those.",

    "text": "Lights that were front & rear of ufo. \n \nThe winter before last, maybe January sometime, at around 11pm, my wife and I were in our hot tub on our deck at the back of our home here in the pacific northwest.  There was snow on the ground but it was a very dark night with a little mist in the air.  Our house is adjacent to some small hills, maybe several hundred vertical feet higher. \n \nOur tub is located on the south side of the house.  I noticed two lights, if you want to call them that, approximately 800 feet away to the west of us, travelling along the hillside at a pace which would be a sprint for a decent runner.  The elevation of these lights was maybe 100 feet up from the ground.  They were probably 30 feet apart, one front and one back, perfectly parallel to the terrain, and moving at a constant speed, slow, with no deviation.   The hillside there is virtually straight up and straight down, no trails and a person couldn’t walk along it at this level these lights were. \n \nAbout the lights…both were solid and the front one never could figure out whether it was blue or white, as you looked at it, it seemed to be in constant change, constant motion within itself, and it was blue and white at the same time.  The rear light was more of a green color and didn’t change.  These so-called lights never reflected or illuminated the sage brush and hillside they were travelling next to the way any regular light would have and I guess this object was no more than 30 feet from the hillside. It wasn’t on a wire, no variation in trajectory with absolute constant pace.  There was something in between these lights that we could not see, namely a vessel, had to be. \n \nIt travelled up to the top of a little hill westbound and stopped and most likely rotated slightly counter-clockwise because the light were closer together.  I went upstairs and got out my binos and observed it for a few minutes. \n \nIt projected out to the northwest an intermittent light that looked like a pattern of corregated roofing metal, red in color and brilliant and I could see it at various distances away from this craft due to the intermittent mist in the area.  This went on for only a minute or so then the lights went out and that was it. \n \nI know what we saw and it obviously wasn’t man made. I expect this was a little mapping expedition or something with a crazy reddish light report sent out.  There’s a few more minor details I’m sure I’ve left out but that’s the gist of it.  I am a retired Fire Captain, college grad in the sciences (chem) and my wife is also college grad. \n \nI have my own opinion on what I think is going around here and maybe you do also, anyways every time go go an evening spa dip we’re looking.  This is the third sighting I’ve experienced in lots of years.  Thanks for listening.",

Hwy 99, from Sacramento to L.A.. \n \nJust south of Sacramento, about Elk Grove area. \n \nI noticed 6 to 7 light peach colored, illuminated objects in the sky. \n \nMoving in a Easterly direction. \n \nHaving been in the Air Force and seeing many air shows at first I thought they were a formation of military helicopters, they were moving about that speed. \n \nSlow and steady.  They did not appear to be that high up (less than a mile. Maybe a half to 3/4).  Being night time it was difficult to tell.  Also, being in a big rig and on a hwy it was not possible to tell by sound (too noisy).  For that same reason I could not tell if it made any noise. \n \nThe formation was very odd as well.  One I've never seen before. \n \n4 points to make a square, then one above to form what would look like the pitch of a house. \n \nThen another 3 times the length out from there.  Pointing in the direction it was going.  East, north easterly. \n \nI've been a night driver for many many years.  I've never seen anything like this before. \n \nMy gut feeling was this was not E.T.. \n \nI did not stop for a better look. So I could not tell if this was one object with lights or several objects (by seeing if there was a star field between them).  They moved in perfect unison. \n \nI watched them for about a min before they and I passed beyond my windshield view. \n \nThe color of the lights were very odd.  Like no color I've ever seen on a flying craft. \n \nNot red nor orange. More like a faint peach color. Or a spot light turned down very low (color wise) yet the light was very illuminated.  Having flown and taken lessons planes have two colors.  One on each wing.  Red and blue or blue green.  White lights forward.  Never peach. \n \nI thought about a blimp for New Years, that's possible, but I sure could not make out its message?  For what it's worth.  Much further south out around hwy 41 and 46 on both hwy 99 and Interstate 5 we have many night time crop dusters that you can get all kinds of crazy light formations (not different colors) because they fly in very weird positions to prepare for crop dusting in a very short span.  My point.  UFO sightings in those areas are more likely crop dusters than anything else.  This or these were definitely not a crop duster.",

All craft were in an almost straight line and evenly spaced, except for the first craft, which was about 3 times further ahead then the rest of the craft were spaced.   \n \nMore craft appeared when the lead craft went out of sight.  There was no noise present and the craft appeared to be at about 30,000 feet and flying north east from the south west.  From my vantage point, they were straight up from a hill, directly to the south of my home.   \n \nEvery craft flew the exact same pattern and were extremely slow.  The last craft took 8 minutes to traverse the same path the previous traveled in less time.  All craft disappeared at the exact same location.   \n \nThere was a low cloud bank but was only partially covering the skies.   \n \nThe path the craft were flying through was not clouded and had very good visibility.",

But the speed was at least 3x faster than any jet engine I have ever seen there was no vapor trail or anything just the orb of white it-self and the speed with no sound which was what caught my attention.

    "text": "Three orange lights in the shape of a triangle in Croswell, MI. \n \nAs I was driving to my house, which was located far from town out in the country, I noticed three orange colored lights in the shape of a triangle hovering over my house.   \n \nWhen I made it to my driveway and pulled in, I got out of my car and by this point the lights were moving farther away and they were now located over the woods approximately 1 mile from my house.  I should add that when I got out of my car the lights were heading northwest and the shape of the triangle was very small, so I assumed it was a great distance away.   \n \nI entered my home shortly after that and made a phone call to my girlfriend at the time to tell her what I saw.  While I was on the phone I was sitting by the window in the front of my house which faces east towards Lake Huron.  Within minutes the lights had reappeared and they were now slowing moving over my house heading east.  This time the distance between the lights had grown a great deal and the triangle shape was very large so it w! as clear this object was much closer to the ground.   \n \nWhen the lights were slowly moving over my house and over my front yard I heard two loud noises upstairs as if something had fallen to the ground.  Mind you, it was in the middle of winter in Michigan, so all of the windows were shut so the wind wouldn't play a factor for knocking something over.   \n \nWhen the noises occurred, my dog ran into the bathroom and jumped into the bathtub trembling as if she was frightened of something, this was completely out of character for her.  I proceeded to walk to the bottom of the stairs and looked up toward the second story.  Being dead silent and dark at the top of the stairs, I was hesitant to check out what the noise was.  This whole time I am on the phone still with my girlfriend, so I told her I was freaked out and I was coming over.  When I got hack over to her house she greeted me at the door and told me that one of her friends had just called and said that she had also spotted three orange lights hovering by her house, which was relatively close to mine.  Having another witness made me feel better so I knew I wasn't imagining things.   \n \nAfter a minute or so of being back at my girlfriends house, her family (mom, dad, brother, and sister) and I went outside to look around the sky to see if we could spot it again.  No more than a minute later we spotted the lights, this time very far away, moving low on the horizon east towards Lake Huron at a great speed.  I know that it was traveling at an unusual speed because I think of when an airplane is 30,000 feet in the air moving at 400mph, from someone watching that airplane in the sky it appears to be moving slow.  The triangle lights were a great distance away and it was moving extremely fast, I would say possibly three or four times the speed of an airplane.  When the lights made it out over the lake they were still clear as day, and then they suddenly disappeared as if they had been shut off all of a sudden.  I want to mention again that not only I saw this object, but six other people witnessed this.  When I returned home later that night, I went immediately upstairs to see what had fallen or to see what could have made the noises from earlier.  When I got upstairs, I thoroughly checked everywhere and there was nothing out of place nor on the ground.  Since this incident I haven't seen it again. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It's a tradition in our house.  \n \nWe banged pots and pans for a few seconds until we felt we brought the new year in.  We could here fireworks and caught glimpses of a few.  When we all heard a loud boom.  It sounded like a bomb in the distance.  It was strange enough sound I made comments of a terrorist attack.  I now think it was the sound of a ufo entering our airspace, like a sonic boom.  I only think that cause as we are staring up in the sky, when literally out of no where three lights in a triangle formation appeared, what seemed like only 1000 ft in the sky and slightly to our west.  The lights were pinkish red to almost a purple color that were bright and not of normal aircraft navagation light colors.  They were in a perfect triangle formation.  We all had to take a second to process what we were seeing.  When then realized this was out of the ord! inary and became very excited.

They were to far apart and would have been some skilled drone pilots.  I believe I could have gotten better footage if I was prepared for such an unexpected event but nonetheless I did capture on camera.

Post stormy day. \n \nWas at the public boat launch at Otsego Lake, closest to the village taking pictures of the skies since they had just cleared up from a day and a half of rain.  As I was taking photos of the sunset (looking west) I noticed a slow flying white object quietly skimming through the air.  Its movements were smooth and it was travelling from north to south.  I had my phone camera and decided to zoom as far as I could with it and take a picture.  I couldn’t determine that it was a rectangle until I looked closer at the photo today just by chance.  Using extra zoom I could enlarge the photo enough to see that it was indeed a white rectangle (not a blimp like I considered) and on the bottom it had a bright amber reflection (lights?).  There was also a haze encasing all sides of the object.   It flew off and slightly turned more south.  Only today did I realize the photo that I had.  I am an adult female, 52 years old, and a hobby photographer.  This is the first time!  I’ve caught a photo like this.

I walked out of my apartment at 2636 grand avenue in San Diego. I walked down the walkway to my car parked on the north side of the building.  On my way to the car I looked up and noticed several Amber lights moving slowly over the la Jolla hills to the north. I thought it strange, but San Diego being a big military city I figured that it was helicopters or some military aircraft. I got in my jeep with the top down and headed north on the I 5 from pacific beach and noticed the lights again as I approached the la Jolla parkway exit and noticed there were 7 or 8 Amber lights at what seemed like an altitude of about 1000 feet above the hill moving extremely slowly from east to west in a sloppy triangle formation! with the rear light occasionally leapfrogging to the front of the formation. It seemed the lights were slightly ahead of me as I proceeded onto la Jolla parkway towards the north west and when I got to the top of the hill and stopped at the traffic light at the intersection of la Jolla parkway and la Jolla shores drive the lights appeared to stay stationary directly above me at an estimated altitude of 1000-2000 feet.  I did not hear any noise other than traffic whatsoever. At this point I concluded if they were helicopters I would surely be hearing them.  I turned north on la Jolla shores drive and proceeded Approximately 1/2 mile to the bath and tennis club and my wife was waiting curbside and got in the jeep. I turned around to a south heading and told my wife about the lights and pointed them out to her. She thought them strange as well. At that time they seemed about 1/2 mile to the west and picking up steady speed. By the time I got back to the traffic light 1/2 mile! south at la Jolla shores drive and la Jolla parkway the light! s seemed at least 5 miles out to sea already and continuing west/northwest. I turned to head east and lost sight of the lights by the time I reached my apartment again about 4-5 minutes later I could not find the lights again",

The town is called Itanhaem, in southeast Sao Paulo State Brazil... \n \n While in the water I looked up towards that cloud and I saw a semi-circular distinctly white object moving very slowly northeast from the clear sky part towards the cloud... \n \n The object was definitely not a plane or helicopter or weather balloon, or some drone type object, and it obviously it was way too low to be a satellite... When this whitish object reached the inside of that thin cloud it actually stopped moving completely, but it was still clearly visible... \n \n I stayed watching it for a few minutes... However, when I looked away for just a few seconds to avoid a bigger wave from hitting my face, I then looked up again at the object and it was gone... I looked around 360 degrees for a couple of minutes to try to spot it again somewhere, but it had vanished completely... \n \n No trace, no trail of smoke or any other sign that it took off suddenly, nothing!... \n \nI have no idea what that object could have been, and how it could have vanished like a light switch being turned off!...

They came up from the south at a medium speed, too slow for a firework rockets or flares, but faster than most airplanes. \n \nThey slowed to a stop still in formation & still due south, hard to guess the distance being dark, but my guess would be about 500-800'in altitude & maybe 5-8 miles due south from us. \n \nThe groups of three seemed to keep perfectly together within each group as if there was one object with three lights each but the different groups of three would vary slightly in position relative to the other groups.  Once they stopped they were still moving slightly around but staying in the same rough area.  There were no flashing lights but the Orange balls seemed to slightly pulse with a subtle color shift from almost yellow to deep reddish orange.   \n \nAfter watching for 2-3 minutes, I ran inside to grab my camera but when I got back less than a minute later, they were gone or moved too low to see due to a 2 story apartment blocking my view.  At first I thought they were part of the neighborhood fireworks, but after watching, it was clear that they weren't. \n \nWe were joking about the fact that they SEEMED to act like they came in close to watch the midnight fireworks show, then left when the fireworks were thinning to a close. \n \nAlso, they made no sound that could be heard.

Continued rising and forming staggered lines with apparently random numbers of lights. \n \nLights travelled in a roughly straight line northerly direction proceeding across the approach path to a Naval Air Station and adjacent bay continuing in direction of major airport.  Lights appeared to be miniature candle-powered hot air balloons but travelled too fast to be propelled by wind only.  Objects accelerated and decelerated.  Some made minor directional changes.  After crossing the bay and before reaching the main airport, objects varyingly:  disappeared, turned to the east and faded, seemed to morph into a small collection of red and green lights so as to appear like a small aircraft, or did all three (3).  Display continued for 10-15 minutes possibly including 30+ objects. \n \nAfter a brief pause, the lights began again coming from a more westerly direction, closer to the beach and rising from behind high-rise condos, this time proceeding more directly perpendicular to aircraft approach and travelling on what might have been a rendezvous path with the previous strings of lights.  Light from the new direction lasted less than 5 minutes. \n \nObservers were part of local family, working professionals, former military, graduate level educations. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

They were low to the NE, rising slowly and steadily up southwards. The top two made a sharp curve west and faded out. By the time the third, flickering slightly, slowly faded from view, 5 or 6 more in a loose constellation followed it in the same direction, disappearing one by one. A very bright one appeared afterwards, taking the same curved route as the first two. It took nearly 10 minutes for the whole spectacle to play out. \n \n I'm not sure of the exact number because once I realized they were not helicopters, I was busy trying to get a picture. Afterwards, I thought they might have been fire balloons -- until I saw the one photo that came out. \n \n Those wild orange swirls are the motions of the orange dots within the second it took to snap the photo. They are NOT the result of camera motion because 1) they are not at all the same, and 2) that bright green squiggle in the lower left is a string of Christmas tree lights across the street, and it's absolutely unblurred and crisp. \n \n I've enhanced color and contrast to make the trails more visible but that's all. \n \n The interesting thing is that my first UFO sighting was also of three glowing orbs and happened exactly two years to the minute on New Years 2016 -- which is why I had the camera ready, though I never expected to see them again.",

    "text": "Several lights seen in semi-circle formation \n \nMy husband went outside to use our grill and quickly called me out to our back deck.  He pointed out a bright light, which appeared to be hovering in the distance, on the left side of our property.  He then pointed to the opposite side of our property and there were between 5-7 very bright lights, which also appeared to hovering.  When scanning from the right side of our house to the left side, you could clearly see they formed a semi circle around the area.  Since there were some trees obstructing our view outside, we ran inside to a large window in the dining room on the side of the house.  From there, we were able to get a very clear view of the lights to the right of our house.  None were moving, all appeared to be hovering.  We questioned if they were perhaps planes, but again, they were not moving and there were no additional lights on them.  Also, I'm sure planes would not even be allowed that close in proximity to each other.  I assume being that clo! se they would be considered in each others air space.  We sat there and watched them for about 20 minutes and then they abruptly disappeared.  They did not fly away or dim, they literally just disappeared.  My husband took video from inside the house which did not come out good, likely due to the window glare.  Shortly after they disappeared (about 10 minutes), another appeared by itself.  I took video of this one from our deck.  It is not good quality, you can only tell that it is a bright light, BUT you can plainly see that it is not moving, just hovering.  We're not totally sure what we saw, but these were definitely not planes.  Very curious to know if anyone else in the area saw this as well.  We live in Lowell, MA.

    "text": "New Years Light Event at Portland International Airport. \n \nEarly morning (from approx 12:45am -1:45am intermittently) New Years Day, 2017, I witnessed an unexplainable series of light events, in the sky of NE Portland, Oregon. \n \nAnd then, something on the tarmac of the Portland International Airport. \n \nThis all began at approx 12:45am. \n \nI was standing on the sidewalk with a friend, in a cul de sac on NE 14th Place, near Killingsworth St. \n \nThere was a set of 2 & 3 story houses and store type buildings immediately to the North of us, and while my friend and I were chatting and wrapping up a social evening for New Years. \n \nNotably, it was a very low key night, my friend doesn’t drink, and I’d had just one light beer, well before midnite… So, as we were chatting, and I was about to get into my car and head home, we noticed that a very odd light had been emanating intermittently, in approx 20-30 second sustained pulse outputs, from well behind the buildings to our North…but spraying the sky with light over us. \n \nWe also noticed a distant “bzzzzzz bzzzzzz bzzzzzz” electrical energy sound that accompanied the sustained light bursts. \n \nAt first, I didn’t think much of the light flashes.  Neither of us did apparently, because we continued talking through the first 2 or 3 of them…  Additionally to note: it had been very cold those few days.  And I believe that high winds/heavy rains had been in the forecast.  I don’t remember the specifics at this time of the forecast that night…  But I do recall, that the conditions were that which can lead to the occasional power surge/exploding transformer, because I remember power outages due to the weather of the night, being a concern in general… along with fallen trees and such. \n \nMy friend who was a former electrical engineer with Intel, years prior to this time, and who was now a leading advisor/consultant on state and federal energy efficiency for government agencies, began to find the situation as odd as I did. \n \nWe agreed to move ourselves quickly, a few hundred feet, to the end of the street to see if we could catch a better view of these lights, in what would next be, the fifth or sixth 30 second sustained pulse of light and sound…  Another odd aspect of this “light show” was that the lights that were constant for the 20-30secs, yet pulsing in intensity, and sometimes “beaming” in a broad spray of faintly focused beams —they were also changing faint colors during the burst, pulsing reds, greens, blues… all of this detail happened faintly, but distinctly enough to be recognizable as separate colors… these bursts and broad beams were also fanning out of the north east direction to our location… from where we were located, and my guessing/calculations of the height of the light and the brightness, combined with my lifelong familiarity of the area… led me to estimate, that if I had to make a guess of the origin point, I would estimate that the light was coming from somewhere between us, and the Portland International Airport. \n \nMy friend recognizing the lateness and his lesser curiosity to find the source —agreed that the whole event was very odd, but that he was calling it a night.  I told him that I was going to investigate this further on my way home… that I would watch the sky, head into the direction that I believed the lights might be originating from, and see what I could find. \n \nI didn’t know of any power station between us and the airport, but I was accepting of the idea that possibly there was one, and that maybe they were having some massive power surges at a local power station, and these sustained 20-30 second bursts of light and buzzing sounds of electrical energy, might be coming from something like that. \n \nOf course he said to “text” him, if I found anything. \n \nBy approx. 1:15am, I had driven Northward through NE Portland, watching the sky and seeing nothing further… until I driven approx 4 miles by road (probably less than 2 miles as the crow flies) to a location along the Columbia River, parking myself at a high vantage point at the M. James Gleason Memorial Boat Ramp, which is situated and Western most point of the Portland International Airport…  I sat there with my eyes intently scanning the horizon, looking back in the direction of NE Portland from where I’d just come… seeing if the event would occur again, back in that direction, or if it were to occur again, would it now be behind me further to the North?  Or what?  I texted my friend, told him where I was parked… and that I’d seen nothing yet. \n \nIf anything changed, I’d let him know in the morning.  (He was not a late night guy really, so I wanted to check-in and alleviate any concerns he might have for me, still being out…)   Then, at approximately 1:40am —a brilliant green burst of light flashed on what I estimated to be Rocky Butte.  Which is basically one of a half dozen elevated hilltop/mounds around the Portland area.  These small hills resemble Lava Cones in Central Oregon…  They might be big enough to top out 400-600 ft above the average ground level around Portland, and they might host 50-100 homes and acres on them, give or take…  My point being, these large ground mounds are elevated enough, that from my vantage point, Rocky Butte was positioned just South Easterly, approx 3-4 miles (as the crow flies) from my location, and I was looking almost directly OVER the Portland Airport, at this new light burst, mid way up Rocky Butte…  Now, I’m no expert on exploding transformers, but THIS event, was much more like what I would have expected an exploding transformer to be, as I had seen an alleged transformer explode once or twice in my past, and seen the light in the sky, followed by a power outage…  But this was in stark contrast to what we had seen earlier.  This particular burst as I said, was bright green.  It was a flash of bright light, similar to looking at an arc welder (which I know you shouldn’t look at) but my point is that it had a distinct light source at it’s core that was very bright (like an explosion) and it was strong flash of green light, maybe lasting as much as five seconds…but definitely not longer. \n \nThis light event did NOT seem extraordinary, BUT, it made me feel like my waiting had paid off, as I had been sitting there almost 30min waiting for SOMETHING to happen…  But this felt like a more mundane event, than what we had witnessed earlier. \n \nI decided to wait another 5 mins and see what might happen. \n \nThen just a few mins later ——— wow.  Just wow. \n \nI’d like to note here, Portland International Airport is home to an Air National Guard squadron (my father flew F102’s out of that base in the 60’s), and it’s also home to some of the top US Air Force Pararescuemen and Combat Controllers in the country.  I had spent a few years working in the special operations community and I had the honor of working with these local guys a little bit over the years, and becoming familiar with the base itself. \n \nThe next “light event” occurred what I estimated at the time, right outside the hangars of the USANG area… granted I was probably at least a mile away, but what I saw was incredible!  A VERY bright green light began to emanate from this point on the base, it got brighter and bigger and sustained itself between approximately 60-75 seconds, an eternity it felt at the time!  This light had something of green diamond shape to it’s light formation when it had reached full intensity after about 10-15 seconds…  I could not believe my eyes… I was running through rational explanations in my head: “it's not an explosion, because it’s sustaining itself… it’s not some search light…because…I’ve never seen ANYTHING like it, and it’s just emanating light, it’s not searching or moving!”  And then, after approx 60-75 seconds… a green beam of light shot straight up into the sky! like a laser…  I can’t explain it, beyond associating it to something you see in the movies… after a few seconds of this sustained green laser beam, directed straight up, I don’t know how far… the burst flashed OUT with an intensity that I can’t really describe.  But when it flashed OFF, it created a ripple of light that rippled southward from there, like an EMP (electro magnetic pulse) wave, that I could see ripple in the sky to the south, OVER the clouds (or through the clouds I guess???) the sky was full of reasonably heavy cloud cover that was present everywhere in the sky… as I had said earlier, it had been heavily raining and very windy that night. \n \nAfter the burst, it was business as usual in the area.  Airport lights were all on. \n \nNothing seemed amiss.  There was NO ACTIVITY in the area of the event……. \n \nSo I decided to wait a few minutes and see if there would be a response on the tarmac, on the base side of the PDX Airport…  I waited a good 5-6mins patiently, for the show.  The response to this. \n \nNothing came.  There was not any sight of activity or change in the area, from my mile away vantage point.  So — I decided to go closer and investigate. \n \nI began the drive around the airport, on the back road to Columbia Blvd, and down the back streets, the back way to the gates of the base…  All the while, keeping my eyes open to the sky for more lights, and keeping my eyes out for any emergency response vehicles…  When I had covered the approx 3 mile drive around to the base, which took maybe…10mins? I found nothing going on there. \n \nNo vehicles moving on base.  No excess of cars parked inside the fence line, as if excessive amounts of personnel were on duty that weekend… in fact there was not even any increase in visible gate security. \n \nI was very confused. \n \nI drove on around the outside of the fence line on the street that parallels the base and passes the entry points to the base, which also has access to the airport tarmac… I drove to a point where I had triangulated my sight line, to where I believed the event had occurred, in relation to specific buildings/hangars and flood light sources on site…  I parked along the gate and got out of my vehicle and stood there a moment. \n \nIt was silent.  It was nearly 2am on New Years Day, and there was nothing happening there at all. \n \nI couldn’t believe no one was there supervising whatever it was.  Or responding to it. \n \nI then drove on around the base, to another vantage point on 82nd Ave, which is a public street that feeds traffic to the Portland airport…  I pulled into the gravel on the side of the road, at a position which would now place me just East of where whatever I saw happen, happened…  I looked everywhere, and i saw nothing…  By now, maybe 15min had passed, since the described event. \n \nI look directly up.  And I notice a HUGE circular opening in the clouds over the airport. \n \nAll of the clouds above the airport were gone.  I could see the stars.  And it was like a giant circle had been cut out of the clouds… maybe a mile across?  Maybe more…  But the sky over the airport was now completely clear. \n \nI can’t explain any of it further than I have. \n \nI went home.",

We then moved to the back deck to see if we could see it further away, when suddenly two more objects (lights) looking exactly like the first light, came into view.  They just drifted on down the valley following the first light and then winked out.  Then three more red lights, looking like the other three, seemed to swoop into view and drifted across toward the field.  One just kept going and winked out, but the fifth one seemed to turn and get brighter and then winked out.  The last light never made it as far as the others and got dimmer and dimmer and went out.  The lights were not blinking or making any sound, so we knew they weren't airplanes or he! licopters.  They all followed the same flight path and the same altitude.  The shape of the lights was unusual.  They were slightly elongated vertically.  There seemed to be something in front of the lights, but it was not discernible.  We tried to be objective and wondered if we were seeing those flying light lanterns or some kind of new fireworks.  They were certainly strange and we had no idea what they were.   \n \nA few nights later, we were listening to Coast to Coast and heard Peter Davenport's report and one of them sounded similar to ours coming from Boise, ID. on the same night.  The report was of 6 red lights.  Our mountain range borders Idaho, and as the crow flies, we're in line from Boise.

I was clicking photos of the bonfire when I saw the Moonrise in the eastern sky.  I alerted everyone that they must look at the beautiful sleepy Moon.  Initially, all looked at the Moon but soon all got engaged with the fun activities around the bonfire. \n \nI kept on clicking the rising Moon’s photos.  I got so engrossed in taking photos of the beautiful Moon using my Nikon P900 camera that I totally forgot I was watching the Moon through a very high optical zoom lens.  Suddenly I saw a HUGE horizontal shadow across the lower part of the Moon; I tried to click the shadow but couldn’t focus and soon realized that the shadow was fast disappearing towards the right side of the Moon. Luckily one click that I took captured a part of the shadow (in the attached photo). \n \nI would request if experts can kindly examine the photo and especially the shadow while it was captured crossing a Moon’s crater the horizontal shadow is clearly appearing crooked on the uneven surface of the crater.",

    "text": "Triangular 3-color craft and accompanying white light \"ball\" craft --overhead sighting \n \nJanuary 10, 2019, 0615 A.M.  Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  While driving south on  87th Street approaching Wisconsin Avenue from the Froedtert Hospital Health Complex, I noticed a white, green and red flashing object in the shape of large “3 corner hat” in the distance toward the south.  It was still dark at this time and the object was very bright and clear.  It seemed to hovering over the general area.  As I turned and proceeded east on Wisconsin Avenue, I noticed that it was actually moving slowly.   \n \nI turned south onto 76th street from Bluemound Avenue.  The object became brighter and continued to alternately flash bright red and green.  I noticed a “bar” of 4 to 5 white lights on the underside of the object which also flashed on and off.  What surprised me then was the appearance of a white bright light “ball” that seemed to meet the 3-corner shape object and then disappear.  As I was approaching the area of the Wisconsin State Fair Park on the 76th street side, which covers approximately one square mile, I noticed that the 3-corner object was passing east to west over the entire area.  I was driving slowly to see if this was some sort of airplane, but it clearly was not as it was traveling east to west over the area, relatively fast.  I then called the non-emergency phone number of the West Allis police department.  The department had not received any other calls on the matter and the operator suggested that I call again if I see the object again.  Unfortunately all law enforcement officers were out on emergent calls and could not be dispatched to confirm my sighting.  I watched as long as possible while driving home and it was very clear that this was a sizable object that I would compare to being a fifth of the size of a full moon in the sky.  The object was low enough to see the 3 corner shape and appeared to be traveling further south as I watched, over a wider area than the State Fair Park area of what is known as the city of West Allis, Wisconsin, known as the Milwaukee postal code area.  I am certain of what I witnessed this morning.",

My wife said OMG and pointed up above us and we both saw a large round shaped object that had a bit of a point and that's why we are calling it tear shaped.  It looked gray in color, silent, guessing about 50 ft above the trees and it was like the size of a baseball diamond.   \n \nThe object didn't move nor make any noise and after watching it for about a minute it then just disappeared.  Our dog is older and seemed to not even notice it and just went about sniffing the little snow on the ground.  We didn't feel scared at all but after it disappeared I did feel like the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I said let's go home which we did.",

My sister commented that two planes shouldn’t be flying that close together. \n \nWe watched the lights and realized they were moving exactly in tandem, one after the other, about the length of a football field apart.  The light in front was a blinking white light, and the lights in the back were blinking in a fast pattern red and white. \n \nWe assumed this was one plane following the other, but then realized that the area between the two sets of lights was totally blacked out, and as it passed, we could see stars blacked out behind it. \n \nIt was very dark, and we couldn’t clearly see an outline of an aircraft, but it appears it was sort of shaped like a long, slim blimp.  There was no noise, and the craft was moving slower than flights we normally see coming into the airport area of Belgrade for landing.  It was also fairly low to the ground, and it continued directly east over Bozeman and continued eastward until we could no longer see the lights. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed quite eloquent and sober-minded to us.

    "text": "On the afternoon of January 10, 2016, I was on my way from my apartment to the store.  As I left My apartment, I  noticed that there was an almost “aspen”  blue sky  (unusual  for the area) and that that there was not one cloud in the sky anywhere.  As I pulled out of my driveway there was the short drive to a stop sign.  I live  in  a rural  area adjacent to the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  There  was no traffic to be seen…also not  unusual for my area and sparsely populated.  I looked across the highway to an uncultivated, empty field and as I glanced up I could see one cloud that was not moving.  It seemed to be cirrus type of cloud only very low in the sky.  I believe the cloud was  not more than 3000 to 4000 feet in elevation.  The bottom portion was thick and the top portion was wispier.  There was a section at the top that was empty of any cloud material and blue sky  could be seen clearly through it. \n \nI was immediately drawn  to this cloud.  I exited my car and leaned back on the front never taking my eyes off of the cloud.  I have no idea how I knew, but I was fully aware that there was an occupied object  of some type  seemingly “hiding” in that cloud.  I occurred to me that the object, which I could not see, must be giving off some type of electrical energy or radiation.  Why else would a person stand in the middle of the street in 30 degree weather  with no coat on. \n \nI watched this cloud, I think without blinking, for a good 7-10 minutes.  I knew something was going to happen…again, I am not sure how.  As if following my wishes, as I was cold and grew impatient  for the event I knew was going to come,  a silver/grey disk rose up in clear view.  Simultaneously, the object took  off  at a speed I can’t begin to explain.  Speed  like  that would kill a human.. the  G-force must have been off the chart.  I tracked it with my eyes, but at the speed it was traveling my eyes were not quick enough and for a moment, I lost track.  I kept my eyes steady and picked it up again and followed the object down range until it appeared  the size of a pinhead.  It headed up, punched through the blue sky and seemingly out of the atmosphere.  I was so close to this event  that I could see the craft was 25-35 feet in diameter.  Also, as it rose up and blasted away, it also took the cloud with it.  I looked back, stunned out of my mind, and there was nothing w! here the cloud had been. \n \nI never did go to the store.  I went straight  back to my apartment and felt that I had been jerked from the reality that  we all live in to another completely different place.  Little did I know that there was more to come. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

    "text": "redish/orange vehicle UFO on AR41 in Ark. near Red River. \n \nJan 31st of 1981 my wife and I with my two daughters went to Broken Bow, Okla.  To visit friends and family of our church that we belonged to before we moved to Hooks, Texas, for my Job.  We attended a watch night service and left there at about 12:30 AM Jan 1, 1982, and visited with one of our close church friends until about 2 AM.  We left Broken Bow on New Years Morning (That 2 AM I mentioned) and headed for Hooks ,Texas. \n \nWe went south on route 259 south towards the Red River Okla/Texas Border, but decided to go by way of DeQueen , Ark . As we were coming into Foreman, Ark.  Off to the south of Foreman, we noticed a very odd thing.  Something was lighting up the sky a reddish orange color so bright it looked almost like a huge forest fire.  Only thing it was pulsating at a regular intervals. \n \nAfter turning south on AR41 going south we could still see this pulsating orangish red light out in the distance.  We traveled on AR41 for about 5 miles when upon hitting a small rise going back down into a shallow valley we saw what at first we thought was an ambulance sitting still on the road not moving an inch.  As we drew nearer, I noticed it looked squarish in shape and had an unusual light display about it that really didn't look like an ambulance that I've ever seen before. \n \n AS we got even closer it began to start moving down the road about 15 miles per hour in a 55 mph zoned road, which was only a two lane road with a non passing divided lines.  I couldn't understand why they were going so slow and my wife kept warning me not to pass it . WE followed this thing until we crested the last little hill just before crossing the Red River (Boarder).  Just as we crested it, the vehicle ahead of us made a swishing sound and appeared to dart straight up in the air.  WE were going down the hill towards the river and near the Arkansas side two highway patrol/or sheriff vehicles were parked as they would do if watching for speeders in either direction.  They had their red flashing lights on while sitting there. \n \nAs we passed them, my two daughter confirmed what my wife and I saw . It appeared as though they were somehow not moving.  They didn't even move or look at us as we passed them at about 3 AM in the morning and only vehicle on the road that time of morning.  We arrived home in Hooks I believe before 3:30 AM  we went to bed and woke up about 9 AM that Morning wanting to see the New Years day happenings on TV.  What we heard was from a local TV station that there had been a UFO sighting near the Red River early that morning and near the river power lines and trees were covered with what some refer to as Angels Hair.  I Told my wife that I had to go see this so we made the trek to the river to see .  The Angels Hair was there and covered quite a bit of things and traffic was somewhat heavy even though the news ask people not to go.  I had my suspicions though and I wanted to check out if what I thought happened did.  That is thinking I saw the vehicle go straight up in the air. \n \nWe crossed the river and I ask my wife to look on her side of the road while I looked on my side to see if maybe there was some kind of side road going off it before the river.  No such turn offs that we could tell off before or even near the top of the rise before dropping off towards the river. \n \nI've looked for any kind of a report on this and could not find anything on line . Except on guy on here on the same date made a report of seeing a reddish/orange light that he says he saw but his I believe he said his sister saw nothing what he did.  Was just wondering if it might have been possibly the same vehicle or thing he saw.",

I noticed a grey diamond shaped object hovering at an angle over the river at Auburn Street Bridge.  I could not take my eyes off of it.  It moved and came toward me, other cars pulled over.  I drove toward it until it was above me and slowed down.  It stayed with me about 30 seconds and only my car.  I placed my head out the window looking up at it about 100 feet above me.  The size was a bit smaller than my car and no sound.  It then sped back to the river quicker than I could get there, angled again with a beam of light to the river and then came back toward me again.  It flew over Eisenhower School and was gone.  I tried to get back quickly but never found it.  When it was above me, I grabbed my phone but it had shut down and could not use it to take a picture.

    "text": "Traveling from Brooklyn, N,Y to Groton, NY on I-80.  My friend and I left out of New York City on New Years Eve.  It was approximately 1:30 AM, New Years Day. \n \nTraffic was light at this time on this particular stretch of interstate. and there were no other cars in our proximity.  We were in a mountainous area, but I'm not sure what town we were near. I was the passenger and my friend was driving.  As we rounded a large turn, we both observed 4 lights at the top of a mountain, situated in an arc which swept upward from left to right from the top of the ridge and up into the sky.  The lights were stationary and resembled a constellation, yet these white lights shone brighter than usual stars and were evenly spaced apart at perhaps 100' intervals.  As we approached NW on the Interstate, they would have been to the lefthand side of us. \n \nBefore either of us could remark to one another about what we were seeing, the lights began to snake down the side of the mountain toward us in a serpentine motion, one after the other.  The lights were very bright, and lit up the trees near them as they moved down the slope. We thought it may have been a group of 4 snowmobiles racing one another.  However, the fact is that when we first saw them, they were stationary in the sky.  The lights also never stopped appearing to shine directly at us as they moved, unlike the lights on the front of a snowmobile or ATV which would have pointed in different directions as the vehicle traversed a trail.  This was also a remote area, at approximately 1:30 AM on New Years Day, so a group of snowmobiles racing at top speed down a steep mountain was not a very likely scenario.  This was the rational explanation which came to both of us after the sighting.  However, we agreed that what we saw were absolutely not conventional vehicles in any way. \n \nWe were both quite stunned and perplexed by what we were witnessing, and by the time I said we should pull over, we rounded a bend and lost sight of the formation of lights.  I remember that during my last glimpse before losing sight of them, the lights were still moving in that organized, serpentine motion and were close to the bottom of the mountainside. \n \nIt is one of my greatest regrets that I didn't have the wherewithal to demand my friend pull over and stop the car while they were in view.  We were both taken too greatly by surprise to stop the car in time.",

    "text": "Bright light at high altitude, looked like a large panel of stadium lights \n \nI had been invited to hog hunt on a remote ranch near Snyder, Texas.  This was a large property, but no ranch house.  We hunted from the afternoon until about midnight (legal in Texas). There was a series of 2 or 3 gates we had to go through, I was driving and a friend was getting the gates.  At the last gate he asked me to come look at something.  It was a light way up in the sky.  Not extremely bright, but brighter than the stars that were out. \n \nThe light didn’t seem to be moving, so I grabbed binoculars and we both looked at it.  It looked like a huge panel of stadium lights.  A perfectly laid out pattern of 18-24 lights.  It was hard to make out because it was at a very high altitude.  There were no other lights around besides my headlights.  We might not have noticed it in town. \n \nWe watched the lights for 10-15 minutes, they didn’t move or change color or intensity.  We decided to leave, and just then the lights just went off.  We never saw any kind of aircraft or anything that could explain the lights.  The only thing I could think of was a satellite, but it was far too low an altitude for a satellite   \n \nI’m an Air Force Veteran and have worked around aircraft all my adult life.  I have no explanation of what this could have been, based on my knowledge of military and civilian aircraft.  I’ve thought about this sighting often, never found anyone else who has seen anything like it.  I remember that date, and I’ve discussed it a few times with the friend who I was with.",

    "text": "UFO over Crow Mountain \n \nI was on my way home one night, less than a mile from my home on crow mountain, when I started watching three planes fly overhead. It was a beautifully clear night with no clouds in the sky.  As I was observing the planes above I almost ran my vehicle into the ditch. In that instance I reminded myself to watch the road and stop admiring the planes in the clear sky. At that moment a “voice” in my head said “no, watch the planes”.  I was slightly startled by this voice in my head because I wasn’t sure that it was my own free thought that was saying this. It didn’t feel authentic to my person/psyche. Curiously I obliged and looked back out of my car window up at the planes.  (Side note: planes fly very low over crow mountain). Out of nowhere an orb appeared. It was a very intense blue colored light that appeared. The light didn’t radiate out from the object like planes lights do.  Meaning when you see a plane at night or even a star, the light emanating from that object splits and shines seemingly in different directions.  This light seemed solid/contained.  The moment I saw it my heart beat sped up and there was this hollow feeling in my chest for I knew what I was seeing.  It’s movements were sporadic “dancing” across the nights sky.  It seemed to approach the planes perpendicular, stopped, and then followed beside them parallel. This only lasted for maybe 10-20 seconds.  It was right above me when it stopped following the planes and seemed to change course.  When it decided to leave it shot off faster than Humanly possible.  It went from being right above me to out of our atmosphere (seemingly) in a matter of 1-3 seconds.  I fully believe that what I saw was a UFO, furthermore, I don’t believe the “voice” in my head was my own.  I swear whole heartedly by this statement.",

January 1st, 2021)) just after midnight at 12:03 AM we were outside on a neighbors patio celebrating New Years Eve.  We were admiring how bright the moon was that evening.  After looking up for a minute or so I noticed a bright Blue Orb moving rapidly in different directions around the moon and pulled out my iPhone since it was so strange and there was no visible light coming from the ground to the Orb.  My wife also pulled out her iPhone to record at different times.  The ORB moved very quickly in the sky and was visible (as it appeared close to the Moon) both with and without cloud cover which was moving rapidly across the Moon.  We have recording on 2 iPhones of this weird event.  On my wife’s recording the size of the Blue Orb appears smaller and then larger.  The Blue Orb appeared, disappeared and re-appeared on several occasions and moved very rapidly. \n \n We sent our video to several folks who noticed the same things we did. \n \nI’ve never reported any UFO sightings in the past and believe this was not a natural phenomenon or some type of laser pointing / sourced event.

    "text": "Three Strange Orbs Ascend Over Pflugerville, Texas During New Year's Fireworks \n \nAt approximately midnight on New Years 2020, I walked out onto back porch in Pflugerville Texas to admire fireworks on the horizon.  During the display, I witnessed three orbs ascended into the air. At first thought, I was trying to figure what kind of firework they were. Then I realized they were too in sync to be fireworks.  They had almost the exact distance from one another; too close together to be commercial air planes.  It would be like planes taking off from an aircraft carrier in the heat of battle.  From the ground I’d say just a few hundred yards from each other.  The orbs were sparkly, not blinking, not red, blue or white.  They were like the glow of sky lanterns but obviously they were in a synchronized flight pattern ascending into the air until they disappeared over the clouds.  The fact it happened during the midnight firework display was almost as if they were trying to camouflage themselves.  I was lucky enough to get my phone out and snap video of! the lights.  Researching online, I found a similar encounter with three orbs back in 2015.  The witnesses photo's and video look very similar to what I witnessed on this night.",

I reacquired the object looking  through the binoculars and could see that it was an orangish color and was definitely rotating at a steady slow pace.  It seemed to be shaped like a parachute canopy.  I watched it through the binoculars for about 1 min before I lost sight of it due to a tree line behind my home.

    "text": "Four orange-yellow pulsating lights in nightime sky \n \nI reside in Gilbert, AZ. I have been a local metro police officer for 20 years in the valley. Prior to working in law enforcement, I served four years in US Naval Special Warfare. \n \nOn 01/01/2020, at approximately 19:20 hours, I walked outside into the backyard with my puppy.  The night sky was partly cloudy, but I could make out some constellations and other random stars to the south.  I could also observe a few visible aircraft heading in different directions as evident by their distinct red, green, and white navigation lights.  Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport is approximately 3 miles southeast of my residence. \n \nHowever, I was looking directly south in the sky when I observed two circular lights appear just above the horizon.  It was as if the lights appeared out of nowhere.  The lights were of an orange-yellow glow that pulsed very slowly, but in unison.  They did not resemble any known aircraft to my knowledge.  The waxing crescent moon was visible in the partly clouded sky directly west.  With the intensity of a bright star, the lights traveled northbound as they ascended into the sky.  The distance between the two lights was comparable to placing my right hand out in front of my sight line while holding up only my index and pinky fingers.  The lights moved very slowly as they continued to ascend in my direction. Moments later, the lights stopped at a fixed point in the sky.  The lights remained in that position for approximately 15-30 seconds.  At that point, the lights started to slowly ascend in a southeast direction. Not only did the lights move upward, but also away into the southern! sky.  Both lights dimmed at the same time and then disappeared into the clouds. \n \nAs I started to walk back inside with the dog, I noticed another singular light emerge from the southern horizon.  It was the exact same light that I had just observed.  The light traveled in the same pattern with the same speed.  It stopped in about the same location for a similar pause before heading away as the previous lights had done.  Again, the singular light just faded into the clouds of the night sky. \n \nBefore I could turn away, I observed a fourth light emerge from the same spot above the horizon. It was the same type of light moving at the same speed as the others.  This time, I opened the back door and called for my wife to hurry outside to get a look at what I was seeing.  The light was still ascending towards me when my wife stepped outside.  She looked on as the singular light stopped in the sky for approximately 15-30 seconds.  Again, she looked on as the light slowly made its way upward and away out of sight.  The whole incident lasted approximately 6 minutes. \n \nI have never seen anything like that before.  Neither my wife nor I could explain the absence of navigational lights.  In addition, we could not provide an explanation for either the pulsing orange-yellow glow, or the speed and travel direction that the lights were exhibiting. \n \nIn the moments following the incident, the partly cloudy night sky cleared up entirely.  Several planes were again observed in the area, but none of them shared any resemblance to what we had just observed.",

    "text": "Reflective triangular vehicle over Las Vegas \n \nEarly evening in January or February 2007 I was on the back of my parked tow truck looking up.  It was a clear night without a moon, and you could see the stars fairly well.  I was not on rotation for any calls, so I had parked in the parking lot of a local community college.  As I was lying there looking up, I realized that I was looking at a perfect reflection of myself and my truck.  There was no sound other than normal street sounds.  Once I realized that I was looking at something moving above me I noted the following: \tIt was triangular in shape with no lights and no obvious mode of how it was moving.  It was traveling very slowly.  If I were to guess I would say it was going about 5 mph.  I would say it was less than 200 feet above me.  In fact, I felt that I could have touched it if I had stood on top of my truck cab.  Of course, I did not do that as I have no idea what this thing is.  As it moved past me to the end of the vehicle the mirror effect made it all but invisible.  There were no lights on the back of it.  The height of it was exceedingly difficult to discern as you could not really see what I would assume to be the edges of it. \n \n\tThis area is near an Air Force base so at the time I figured it must be a new weapon of some sort.  I did mention it to the dispatcher at the time, but they laughed it off.  I have not seen this particular type of vehicle since.

    "text": "Five of us watched a formation of about 40+ sparkling objects fade in and out below the moon for about 10 minutes. \n \nJust after New Year's Eve midnight, our group of five was outside. One member of our group looked up at the moon and exclaimed: Look! She pointed toward the moon, which was full and bright in the southeast. We all looked up. At first, we were silent. Then we started saying many things like: I see it! Do you see this? I can't believe it! This is not natural or man-made!  The formation had 40 or more lights. The lights were spread out in a vertical band, ranging from below the moon down toward the horizon. Each light was a separate sparkle made of short, thin, sharp, crisscrossing, radiating lines. Each sparkle was small relative to the overall formation. \n \nFour out of five in our group saw different colors among the sparkles. The fifth in our group (me) had coated eyeglasses and did not see the colors. The sparkles did not look like stars. Each sparkle would be in the same spot for about 15 to 30 seconds, then fade. But the approximate number of sparkles in the formation stayed the same for most of the time that we observed it. Then the sparkles started to fade and disappeared entirely over one or two minutes. \n \nThe overall formation stayed in the same general area but constantly shifted slightly as some sparkles faded in and others faded out. The overall shape of the formation was resembled a geometric kite, with more sparkles at the top closest to the moon, and with fewer sparkles ranging down along a kite tail decorated with knots. The overall shape of the formation, though, was not distinct or familiar, and it did not maintain a consistent shape. \n \nThe formation was visible for about 10 minutes and then the number of visible sparkles started to fade. Within a minute all of the sparkles were gone. \n \nI photographed and filmed some of the event with my iPhone, but the formation does not seem visible on my phone or on my desktop. \n \nWhile we were watching, someone in our group said it was like plankton glowing at night in the sea. Four of us had seen pictures of glowing plankton and agreed there was a similarity. The major difference was the sparkling characteristic of each object in the formation versus the glow of plankton at night.",

After viewing it for a short period of time (2 minutes or less), the orb flew off.  We thought this was weird, but possibly connected to the fireworks going on around us. We then were even more surprised when it appeared that there was another orange fireball-like orb floating in a similar spot.  Over the course of a half hour, we saw over 20 of these orbs slowly float above our street, speed up, and disappear into the sky.  The orbs were simply a ball of fire, and were extremely bright and high up in the sky.",

    "text": "Six orange/red orbs one by one flew over Tempe AZ new years eve 2020 over 18 min from low altitude to disappearing into space \n \nAt midnight new years eve 2020, a friend and I observed six silent dark orange/red spherical glowing flying objects over an 18 minute time period. They appeared one by one, about every three minutes, from midnight to 12:18 AM. \n \nFive of the objects moved from my east to my west, and one moved from my northwest to my southeast. The first two objects were a little north of me, the second two almost directly overhead, and the last two a little south of my location. \n \nThe objects first appeared at about a 40 degree angle to ground  position, and appeared about 1/5 the size of an average moon when passing over our position.  They looked like large military helicopter size, but as they steadily moved forward, away and upward, they appeared smaller and smaller, until they disappeared into space on the distant horizon.  It took about three minutes from initial sighting, at what appeared as lower altitude, to disappearance, at what appeared to we extremely high altitude.  It was difficult to estimate altitude, but I first thought the first object was a sheriff's helicopter, at low altitude, coming because of new years gunshots. \n \nUpon two of the objects, one by one, disappearance in the eastern sky, I saw four separate blue/white flashes/sparks in the dark sky, near where the objects were last seen. They looked like photo flash bulbs or sparks going off in the sky, roughly the diameter of an average moon.  I have never seen anything like that, and the sparks occurred at a very high altitude. \n \nBefore the last object traveled from the NW to the SE, I ran in an grabbed my 15X x 70mm Celestron astronomical binoculars.  I was able to focus and view the last object clearly for over 10 seconds, as it was moving away.  It appeared to be reddish orange glowing perfectly spherical plasma (there was a flaming character to it), with a round white halo around it. The halo was six times the size of the ball. The halo reflected white light against some slight feathery clouds that were present. There was no trail, contrail, or exhaust coming from the object. \n \nI have worked in aerospace and defense procurement and manufacturing, for over 40 years.  I know what satellites look like in the night sky.  I know what helicopters and jet aircraft look like in the night sky. These objects were UAP, and exibited high strangeness.  I know Sky Harbor tower had to have seen the objects, but, I no longer have any FAA contacts to refer to. \n \nI waited for an hour after 12:18 AM to see if there would be further activity, and there was none.  It is worthy of note that my internet search that night found videos of orange/red orbs captured at midnight new years eve 2020 in over 10 US states, and in Autrailia, The Netherlands, The UK, Mexico, and others.  These videos match what we saw, only our sightings seemed much closer at first viewing, when the objects were at low altitude. \n \nOddly, all the internet videos seem to have been taken at midnight their time zone, right when people were watching fireworks displays.  All the objects and descriptions of the objects seem to be very similar.  Very strange phenomenon, indeed.",

    "text": "Catskills (Mt.Tremper) NIGHT TIME UFO SIGHTINGS \n \nIt was 4 in the morning and I still had not fallen asleep because I felt very uneasy and overall \"off\". Im looking out my bedroom window where in the distance I see what looks like a blinking cellular tower (but we live in the middle of nowhere) I then spot a medium sized saucer with white and red lights, that's spinning and moving toward the blinking light. (Im assuming the blinking light was also another ufo) The saucer wasn't moving very fast, and I got a pretty good look at it while it was moving. I was in shock while staring at it, and found myself hyperventilating and unable to move. After it traveled out of eyes view, I woke up my brother to tell him what happened and he slept in the room with me for the rest of the night. We both stayed up looking out the window, when we see another identical ufo going in the exact same path as the previous one. Then about 30 minutes later, another one comes from the opposite  direction, also disappearing i! nto the horizon. In around 45 minutes to an hour, a huge green glowing triangular shaped object comes from the same direction as the first 2, while its red and white lights are turning on and off in a wave formation as it ascends. Not even 20 seconds later, from the opposite direction again, comes another ufo. This one almost appears to be \"broken\", its lights are flickering on and off while it rocks back and forth similar to a boat on rough waters. At this point I could see both of them moving at the same time. All of these ufos disappeared into the horizon, while maintaining their flickering lights. I am positive these were not airplanes, as we are in a very remote area, never see planes, and they were flying way to low to be a commercial jet. After the first initial sighting, I was up all night looking for answers, and did not expect to see 4 more ufos.",

In the video I zoomed in as much as my phone would let me and just sat and watched my phone screen as it was recording the object. The glowing, light up object was pulsating as well as bouncing up and down up and down then would just disappear. All of a sudden the object would be back on the screen in a different position glowing brighter. When I would look away from my screen the object was not moving as far as I could see with my naked eye, but was darting all over the place on the screen which really freaked me out then the object disappeared again. Returned. Disappeared for a good while and then all of a sudden the object came back clear vision bright as ever and just kept getting brighter and bigger and turns green. Then disappeared and my camera couldn't record any longer.",

    "text": "Triangular craft descending and hovering by radio tower. \n \nFirst, the story: I was hesitant to write this experience but I feel like it is something I should share.  I was driving north on I-95 in Georgia, USA between Brunswick and Savannah in Georgia after visiting my sister in Florida .  The date was 1/11/2020 and around 1:30 AM is when it happened.  As I was driving all off the sudden, very high up in the atmosphere a red light appeared, directly to the right (east) of the highway.  It stayed there for a second or 2 before descending, very rapidly, over the course of 4-5 seconds to just above the tree line. It struck me as odd because the lights didn't blink, they were very bright from a distance, and the distance that it descended in that time was staggering.  I thought it was a plane descending the opposite direction I was traveling but the non blinking lights and fast descent threw me off.  It stopped at the end of the descent, right above the tree line, where it remained stationary.  Numerous times when I have been driving I have noticed that when pla! nes travel in the opposite direction to you, when they are low they give the appearance they are stationary so I chalked it up to that, but something still seemed off.  It took about 10 seconds before I got to the craft (I was traveling ~80 mph) and realized it was something I've never seen before. When I passed it, it was hovering about 50 ft SE and 50 ft vertical (best guess) over the tower east of I-95 and a side road (the side road was directly east of I-95, south of belfast keller road). This tower is right off the highway, maybe 100 feet. It was so close and low, and so crystal clear that I couldn't really process what I had seen at the time. It was ever so slightly rotating (barely discernable) clockwise in the x and y direction (z being vertical or normal to the earth) when I passed it. After I passed it I looked in the rear view mirror and couldn't see anything but I think the tree line hid it from that angle. I didn't have a good night camera at the time either (my! cell phone camera was cracked, and on top of that takes horri! ble nigh t pictures), which I wish I had. It was also a long drive (~7 hours) so I kept on driving to get home. The only thing I could think of was that this was military in nature and that the craft liked radio towers. \n \n Description of craft: I would describe the craft as follows but I have also made a 3D CAD model of it as well in autodesk inventor. It was shaped like an equilateral triangle, with each side having the length of a semi truck with trailer or slightly bigger. The edges of that triangle were chamfered and it appeared to have no thickness due to the angle I saw it at. There were 6 lights, symmetric about the center and having the same exact color as a car brakelight. There was another triangular shaped, vertically recessed area in the center that was chamfered to the lower section.. In that center, there was a dome (Imagine a sphere that has been chopped at 1/3 to 1/4 of it's diameter) that appeared to be made of a thick glass but whatever was underneath was the blackest black I have ever seen. It stood out. I was driving so I couldn't say it made no noise but it didn't make any discernable noise.",

Also there was no sound at all coming from the aircraft and as close as it was I would’ve been able to hear some type of engine running was not able to make visual contact on rotors or anything rotating to keep it in-flight.",
